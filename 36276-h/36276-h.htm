SPACE AND TIME IN PRE-RELATIVITY
PHYSICS</h2>

<p class="nind">
<span class="dropcap">T</span>HE theory of relativity is intimately connected with the theory
of space and time. I shall therefore begin with a brief investigation
of the origin of our ideas of space and time, although in
doing so I know that I introduce a controversial subject. The
object of all science, whether natural science or psychology, is
to co-ordinate our experiences and to bring them into a logical
system. How are our customary ideas of space and time related
to the character of our experiences?
</p>
<p>
The experiences of an individual appear to us arranged in a
series of events; in this series the single events which we remember
appear to be ordered according to the criterion of "earlier"
and "later," which cannot be analysed further. There exists,
therefore, for the individual, an I-time, or subjective time. This
in itself is not measurable. I can, indeed, associate numbers with
the events, in such a way that a greater number is associated
with the later event than with an earlier one; but the nature of
this association may be quite arbitrary. This association I can
define by means of a clock by comparing the order of events furnished
by the clock with the order of the given series of events.
We understand by a clock something which provides a series of
events which can be counted, and which has other properties of
which we shall speak later.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</span>
</p>
<p>
By the aid of speech different individuals can, to a certain
extent, compare their experiences. In this way it is shown that
certain sense perceptions of different individuals correspond to
each other, while for other sense perceptions no such correspondence
can be established. We are accustomed to regard as real
those sense perceptions which are common to different individuals,
and which therefore are, in a measure, impersonal. The natural
sciences, and in particular, the most fundamental of them,
physics, deal with such sense perceptions. The conception of
physical bodies, in particular of rigid bodies, is a relatively constant
complex of such sense perceptions. A clock is also a body,
or a system, in the same sense, with the additional property that
the series of events which it counts is formed of elements all of
which can be regarded as equal.
</p>
<p>
The only justification for our concepts and system of concepts
is that they serve to represent the complex of our experiences;
beyond this they have no legitimacy. I am convinced that
the philosophers have had a harmful effect upon the progress
of scientific thinking in removing certain fundamental concepts
from the domain of empiricism, where they are under our control,
to the intangible heights of the <i>a priori</i>. For even if it should
appear that the universe of ideas cannot be deduced from experience
by logical means, but is, in a sense, a creation of the
human mind, without which no science is possible, nevertheless
this universe of ideas is just as little independent of the nature
of our experiences as clothes are of the form of the human body.
This is particularly true of our concepts of time and space, which
physicists have been obliged by the facts to bring down from the
Olympus of the <i>a priori</i> in order to adjust them and put them
in a serviceable condition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
</p>
<p>
We now come to our concepts and judgments of space. It
is essential here also to pay strict attention to the relation of
experience to our concepts. It seems to me that Poincaré clearly
recognized the truth in the account he gave in his book, "La
Science et l'Hypothèse." Among all the changes which we can
perceive in a rigid body those are marked by their simplicity
which can be made reversibly by an arbitrary motion of the
body; Poincaré calls these, changes in position. By means of
simple changes in position we can bring two bodies into contact.
The theorems of congruence, fundamental in geometry, have to
do with the laws that govern such changes in position. For the
concept of space the following seems essential. We can form new
bodies by bringing bodies <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C">, ... up to body <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">; we say that
we <i>continue</i> body <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">. We can continue body <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A"> in such a way that
it comes into contact with any other body, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.928ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X">. The ensemble of
all continuations of body <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A"> we can designate as the "space of
the body <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">." Then it is true that all bodies are in the "space of
the (arbitrarily chosen) body <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">." In this sense we cannot speak
of space in the abstract, but only of the "space belonging to a
body <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">." The earth's crust plays such a dominant rôle in our
daily life in judging the relative positions of bodies that it has
led to an abstract conception of space which certainly cannot be
defended. In order to free ourselves from this fatal error we shall
speak only of "bodies of reference," or "space of reference." It
was only through the theory of general relativity that refinement
of these concepts became necessary, as we shall see later.
</p>
<p>
I shall not go into detail concerning those properties of the
space of reference which lead to our conceiving points as elements
of space, and space as a continuum. Nor shall I attempt
to analyse further the properties of space which justify the conception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
of continuous series of points, or lines. If these concepts
are assumed, together with their relation to the solid bodies of
experience, then it is easy to say what we mean by the three-dimensionality
of space; to each point three numbers, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{3}">
(co-ordinates), may be associated, in such a way that this association
is uniquely reciprocal, and that <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{3}"> vary
continuously when the point describes a continuous series of points
(a line).
</p>
<p>
It is assumed in pre-relativity physics that the laws of the
orientation of ideal rigid bodies are consistent with Euclidean
geometry. What this means may be expressed as follows: Two
points marked on a rigid body form an <i>interval</i>. Such an interval
can be oriented at rest, relatively to our space of reference, in
a multiplicity of ways. If, now, the points of this space can
be referred to co-ordinates <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{3}">, in such a way that the
differences of the co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/8.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{2}">,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 1.994ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{3}">, of the two ends
of the interval furnish the same sum of squares,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 34.482ex; height: 2.633ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
s^{2} = {\Delta x_{1}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{2}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{3}}^{2}, \qquad\text{(1)}
"></span>
for every orientation of the interval, then the space of reference
is called Euclidean, and the co-ordinates Cartesian.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is
sufficient, indeed, to make this assumption in the limit for an
infinitely small interval. Involved in this assumption there are
some which are rather less special, to which we must call attention
on account of their fundamental significance. In the first
place, it is assumed that one can move an ideal rigid body in an
arbitrary manner. In the second place, it is assumed that the behaviour
of ideal rigid bodies towards orientation is independent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of the material of the bodies and their changes of position, in the
sense that if two intervals can once be brought into coincidence,
they can always and everywhere be brought into coincidence.
Both of these assumptions, which are of fundamental importance
for geometry and especially for physical measurements,
naturally arise from experience; in the theory of general relativity
their validity needs to be assumed only for bodies and spaces
of reference which are infinitely small compared to astronomical
dimensions.
</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind"><a id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>This relation must hold for an arbitrary choice of the origin and of the
direction
(ratios <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 16.271ex; height: 1.994ex;" src="images/12.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{1}: \Delta x_{2}: \Delta x_{3}">)
of the interval.</p></div>

<p>
The quantity <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s"> we call the length of the interval. In order
that this may be uniquely determined it is necessary to fix arbitrarily
the length of a definite interval; for example, we can put
it equal to 1 (unit of length). Then the lengths of all other intervals
may be determined. If we make the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}"> linearly dependent
upon a parameter <img style="vertical-align: -0.027ex; width: 1.319ex; height: 1.597ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda">,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 14.299ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
x_{\nu} = a_{\nu} + \lambda b_{\nu},
"></span>
we obtain a line which has all the properties of the straight
lines of the Euclidean geometry. In particular, it easily follows
that by laying off <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> times the interval <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s"> upon a straight line, an
interval of length <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 4.053ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n·s"> is obtained. A length, therefore, means
the result of a measurement carried out along a straight line by
means of a unit measuring rod. It has a significance which is as
independent of the system of co-ordinates as that of a straight
line, as will appear in the sequel.
</p>
<p>
We come now to a train of thought which plays an analogous
role in the theories of special and general relativity. We ask
the question: besides the Cartesian co-ordinates which we have
used are there other equivalent co-ordinates? An interval has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
a physical meaning which is independent of the choice of co-ordinates;
and so has the spherical surface which we obtain as
the locus of the end points of all equal intervals that we lay off
from an arbitrary point of our space of reference. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}"> as well
as <img style="vertical-align: -0.559ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 2.276ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x'_{\nu}"> (<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> from 1 to 3) are Cartesian co-ordinates of our space
of reference, then the spherical surface will be expressed in our
two systems of co-ordinates by the equations
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -3.006ex; width: 31.357ex; height: 7.142ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\begin{align*}
\sum {\Delta x_{\nu}}^{2} &= \text{const.} \qquad & &\text{(2)} \\
\sum {{\Delta x'}_{\nu}}^{2} &= \text{const.} \qquad & &\text{(2a)}
\end{align*}
"></span>
How must the <img style="vertical-align: -0.559ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 2.276ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x'_{\nu}"> be expressed in terms of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}"> in order that
equations (2) and (2a) may be equivalent to each other? Regarding
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.559ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 2.276ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x'_{\nu}"> expressed as functions of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}">, we can write,
by Taylor's theorem, for small values of the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.885ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}">,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -3.06ex; width: 52.322ex; height: 6.477ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{\Delta x'}_{\nu}
  = \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\partial {x'}_{\nu}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}\, \Delta x_{\alpha}
  + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha \text{,} \beta}
    \frac{\partial^{2} {x'}_{\nu}}{\partial x_{\alpha}\, \partial x_{\beta}}\,
    \Delta x_{\alpha}\, \Delta x_{\beta}.\ldots
"></span>
If we substitute (2a) in this equation and compare with (1),
we see that the <img style="vertical-align: -0.559ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 2.276ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x'_{\nu}"> must be linear functions of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}">. If we
therefore put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -4.542ex; width: 42.282ex; height: 10.216ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\qquad & &\text{(3)}\\
&\text{or} & \Delta {x'}_{\nu} &= \sum_{\alpha} b_{\nu\alpha}\, \Delta x_{\alpha},
\qquad & &\text{(3a)}
\end{align*}"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
then the equivalence of equations (2) and (2a) is expressed in

conditions (4) are called the conditions of orthogonality, and the
transformations (3), (4), linear orthogonal transformations. If
we stipulate that <img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 13.034ex; height: 2.633ex;" src="images/30.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s^2 = \sum {\Delta x_{\nu}}^2"> shall be equal to the square of

the linear orthogonal transformations are the only ones by
means of which we can pass from one Cartesian system of co-ordinates

applying such transformations the equations of a straight line
become equations of a straight line. Reversing equations (3a)
by multiplying both sides by <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.912ex; height: 2.22ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b_{\nu\beta}"> and summing for all

<p>
To sum up, we can say that in the Euclidean geometry
there are (in a given space of reference) preferred systems of
co-ordinates, the Cartesian systems, which transform into each
other by linear orthogonal transformations. The distance <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s"> between
two points of our space of reference, measured by a measuring
rod, is expressed in such co-ordinates in a particularly
simple manner. The whole of geometry may be founded upon
this conception of distance. In the present treatment, geometry
is related to actual things (rigid bodies), and its theorems are
statements concerning the behaviour of these things, which may
prove to be true or false.
</p>
<p>
One is ordinarily accustomed to study geometry divorced
from any relation between its concepts and experience. There
are advantages in isolating that which is purely logical and independent
of what is, in principle, incomplete empiricism. This
is satisfactory to the pure mathematician. He is satisfied if he
can deduce his theorems from axioms correctly, that is, without
errors of logic. The question as to whether Euclidean geometry
is true or not does not concern him. But for our purpose it
is necessary to associate the fundamental concepts of geometry
with natural objects; without such an association geometry is
worthless for the physicist. The physicist is concerned with the
question as to whether the theorems of geometry are true or
not. That Euclidean geometry, from this point of view, affirms
something more than the mere deductions derived logically from
definitions may be seen from the following simple consideration.

<p>
From the foregoing it is evident that the equations of transformation
(3), (4) have a fundamental significance in Euclidean
geometry, in that they govern the transformation from one
Cartesian system of co-ordinates to another. The Cartesian
systems of co-ordinates are characterized by the property that
in them the measurable distance between two points, <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s">, is

then

</p>
<p>
The right-hand side is identically equal to the left-hand side
on account of the equations of the linear orthogonal transformation,
and the right-hand side differs from the left-hand side
only in that the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}"> are replaced by the <img style="vertical-align: -0.559ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 2.276ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x'_{\nu}">. This is expressed
by the statement that <img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 7.968ex; height: 2.633ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sum {\Delta x_{\nu}}^{2}"> is an invariant with respect to
linear orthogonal transformations. It is evident that in the Euclidean
geometry only such, and all such, quantities have an
objective significance, independent of the particular choice of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the Cartesian co-ordinates, as can be expressed by an invariant
with respect to linear orthogonal transformations. This is
the reason that the theory of invariants, which has to do with
the laws that govern the form of invariants, is so important for
analytical geometry.
</p>
<p>
As a second example of a geometrical invariant, consider a
volume. This is expressed by
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.948ex; width: 21.373ex; height: 5.027ex;" src="images/47.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

By means of Jacobi's theorem we may write

where the integrand in the last integral is the functional determinant
of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.559ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 2.276ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x'_{\nu}"> with respect to the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}">, and this by (3) is equal
to the determinant <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 4.229ex; height: 2.381ex;" src="images/49.svg" alt=" " data-tex="|b_{\mu\nu}|"> of the coefficients of substitution, <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.03ex; height: 1.927ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b_{\nu\alpha}">.

we form the determinant of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.181ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/50.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta_{\mu\alpha}"> from equation (4), we obtain,
by means of the theorem of multiplication of determinants,

If we limit ourselves to those transformations which have the determinant
+1,<a id="FNanchor_3_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and only these arise from continuous variations
of the systems of co-ordinates, then <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.74ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/52.svg" alt=" " data-tex="V"> is an invariant.
</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind"><a id="Footnote_3_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_1"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>There are thus two kinds of Cartesian systems which are designated as
"right-handed" and "left-handed" systems. The difference between these is
familiar to every physicist and engineer. It is interesting to note that these
two kinds of systems cannot be defined geometrically, but only the contrast
between them.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p>
Invariants, however, are not the only forms by means of
which we can give expression to the independence of the particular
choice of the Cartesian co-ordinates. Vectors and tensors
are other forms of expression. Let us express the fact that the
point with the current co-ordinates <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}"> lies upon a straight line.
We have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 31.899ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/53.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
x_{\nu} - A_{\nu} = \lambda B_{\nu} \quad (\nu \text{ from 1 to 3}).
"></span>
Without limiting the generality we can put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.018ex; width: 12.162ex; height: 3.167ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\sum {B_{\nu}}^{2} = 1.
"></span>
</p>
<p>
If we multiply the equations by <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.912ex; height: 2.22ex;" src="images/55.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b_{\beta\nu}"> (compare (3a) and (5))
and sum for all the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu">'s, we get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.869ex; width: 15.719ex; height: 2.699ex;" src="images/56.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.602ex; width: 34.129ex; height: 4.751ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

A'_{\beta} = \sum_{\nu} b_{\beta\nu} A_{\nu}.

</p>
<p>
These are the equations of straight lines with respect to a
second Cartesian system of co-ordinates <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">'. They have the
same form as the equations with respect to the original system
of co-ordinates. It is therefore evident that straight lines
have a significance which is independent of the system of co-ordinates.
Formally, this depends upon the fact that the quantities (<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 7.828ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/59.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu} - A_{\nu}">) - <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.072ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda B_{\nu}"> are
transformed as the components of
an interval, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.214ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/61.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{\nu}">. The ensemble of three quantities, defined for
every system of Cartesian co-ordinates, and which transform as
the components of an interval, is called a vector. If the three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
components of a vector vanish for one system of Cartesian co-ordinates,
they vanish for all systems, because the equations of
transformation are homogeneous. We can thus get the meaning
of the concept of a vector without referring to a geometrical representation.
This behaviour of the equations of a straight line
can be expressed by saying that the equation of a straight line
is co-variant with respect to linear orthogonal transformations.
</p>
<p>
We shall now show briefly that there are geometrical entities
which lead to the concept of tensors. Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/62.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{0}"> be the centre of a
surface of the second degree, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/63.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> any point on the surface, and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.027ex; height: 2.057ex;" src="images/64.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\xi_{\nu}"> the projections of the interval <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 4.139ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/65.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{0}P"> upon the co-ordinate axes.
Then the equation of the surface is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.018ex; width: 15.789ex; height: 3.167ex;" src="images/66.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\sum a_{\mu\nu} \xi_{\mu} \xi_{\nu} = 1.
"></span>
In this, and in analogous cases, we shall omit the sign of summation,
and understand that the summation is to be carried out
for those indices that appear twice. We thus write the equation
of the surface
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 12.144ex; height: 2.278ex;" src="images/67.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

"></span>
The quantities <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.197ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/68.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a_{\mu\nu}"> determine the surface completely, for a given

find the law of transformation for the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.197ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/68.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a_{\mu\nu}">:<a id="FNanchor_4_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

<p>
Analytic tensors of higher rank (number of indices) may be
defined. It is possible and advantageous to regard vectors as
tensors of rank 1, and invariants (scalars) as tensors of rank 0.
In this respect, the problem of the theory of invariants may be so
formulated: according to what laws may new tensors be formed
from given tensors? We shall consider these laws now, in order
to be able to apply them later. We shall deal first only with the
properties of tensors with respect to the transformation from
one Cartesian system to another in the same space of reference,

<i>Remark</i>. From this definition it follows that

Conversely, the tensor character of (<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">) may be inferred, if it
is known that the expression (8) leads to an invariant for an

<p>
<i>Addition and Subtraction</i>. By addition and subtraction of
the corresponding components of tensors of the same rank, a
tensor of equal rank results:

The proof follows from the definition of a tensor given above.

<i>Multiplication</i>. From a tensor of rank <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and a tensor of

<p>
In addition to these elementary rules of operation there is
also the formation of tensors by differentiation ("erweiterung"):

New tensors, in respect to linear orthogonal transformations,
may be formed from tensors according to these rules of operation.

<i>Symmetrical Properties of Tensors</i>. Tensors are called symmetrical
or skew-symmetrical in respect to two of their indices,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu">, if both the components which result from interchanging
the indices <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> are equal to each other or equal with
opposite signs.
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.156ex; width: 46.294ex; height: 5.442ex;" src="images/87.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\begin{alignat*}{2}
&\text{Condition for symmetry:} &
  A_{\mu\nu\rho} &= A_{{\nu\mu}\rho}. \\
&\text{Condition for skew-symmetry:}\quad &
  A_{\mu\nu\rho} &= -A_{\nu\mu\rho}. \\
\end{alignat*}
"></span>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Theorem</i>. The character of symmetry or skew-symmetry
exists independently of the choice of co-ordinates, and in this
lies its importance. The proof follows from the equation defining tensors.
</p>
<p>
<i>Special Tensors.</i>
</p>
<p>
I. The quantities <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 2.933ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/88.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta_{\rho\sigma}"> (4) are tensor components
(fundamental tensor).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Proof</i>. If in the right-hand side of the equation of transformation
<img style="vertical-align: -0.904ex; width: 3.697ex; height: 2.622ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A'_{\mu\nu}"> = <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.147ex; height: 2.255ex;" src="images/90.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b_{\mu\alpha}"><img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.912ex; height: 2.22ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b_{\nu\beta}"><img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.814ex; height: 2.27ex;" src="images/91.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\alpha\beta}">, we substitute
for <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.814ex; height: 2.27ex;" src="images/91.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\alpha\beta}"> the quantities <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.122ex; height: 2.272ex;" src="images/27.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta_{\alpha\beta}"> (which are equal
to 1 or 0 according as <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> = <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> or <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> ≠ <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">),
we get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 20.17ex; height: 2.515ex;" src="images/92.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{A'}_{\mu\nu} = b_{\mu\alpha} b_{\nu\alpha} = \delta_{\mu\nu}.
"></span>
The justification for the last sign of equality becomes evident if
one applies (4) to the inverse substitution (5).
</p>
<p>
II. There is a tensor (<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 5.707ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/93.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta_{\mu\nu\rho\ldots}">) skew-symmetrical with respect
to all pairs of indices, whose rank is equal to the number of
dimensions, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">, and whose components are equal to +1 or -1
according as <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 6.762ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/94.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu\nu\rho\ldots"> is an even or odd permutation of 1 2 3....
</p>
<p>
The proof follows with the aid of the theorem proved above
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 8.305ex; height: 2.381ex;" src="images/95.svg" alt=" " data-tex="|b_{\rho\sigma}| = 1">
</p>
<p>
These few simple theorems form the apparatus from the
theory of invariants for building the equations of pre-relativity
physics and the theory of special relativity.
</p>
<p>
We have seen that in pre-relativity physics, in order to specify
relations in space, a body of reference, or a space of reference,
is required, and, in addition, a Cartesian system of co-ordinates.
We can fuse both these concepts into a single one by thinking
of a Cartesian system of co-ordinates as a cubical frame-work
formed of rods each of unit length. The co-ordinates of the lattice
points of this frame are integral numbers. It follows from
the fundamental relation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 34.607ex; height: 2.633ex;" src="images/96.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
s^{2} = {\Delta x_{1}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{2}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{3}}^{2}
\qquad\text{(13)}
"></span>
that the members of such a space-lattice are all of unit length.
To specify relations in time, we require in addition a standard
clock placed at the origin of our Cartesian system of co-ordinates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
or frame of reference. If an event takes place anywhere we can
assign to it three co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}">, and a time <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">, as soon as
we have specified the time of the clock at the origin which is
simultaneous with the event. We therefore give an objective significance
to the statement of the simultaneity of distant events,
while previously we have been concerned only with the simultaneity
of two experiences of an individual. The time so specified
is at all events independent of the position of the system of co-ordinates
in our space of reference, and is therefore an invariant
with respect to the transformation (3).
</p>
<p>
It is postulated that the system of equations expressing the
laws of pre-relativity physics is co-variant with respect to the
transformation (3), as are the relations of Euclidean geometry.
The isotropy and homogeneity of space is expressed in this way.<a id="FNanchor_5_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
We shall now consider some of the more important equations of
physics from this point of view.
</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind"><a id="Footnote_5_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_1"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>The laws of physics could be expressed, even in case there were a
unique direction in space, in such a way as to be co-variant with respect
to the transformation (3); but such an expression would in this case be
unsuitable. If there were a unique direction in space it would simplify the
description of natural phenomena to orient the system of co-ordinates in
a definite way in this direction. But if, on the other hand, there is no
unique direction in space it is not logical to formulate the laws of nature
in such a way as to conceal the equivalence of systems of co-ordinates that
are oriented differently. We shall meet with this point of view again in the
theories of special and general relativity.</p></div>

The equations of motion of a material particle are
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 22.955ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/98.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

(<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.506ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\nu}">) is a vector; <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.993ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dt">, and therefore also <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 2.989ex; height: 4.613ex;" src="images/101.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{dt}">, an invariant; thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
(<img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 4.502ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{dx_{\nu}}{dt}">) is a vector; in the same way it may be shown that
(<img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 5.489ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/103.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{d^{2} x_{\nu}}{dt^{2}}">) is a vector. In general, the operation of differentiation
with respect to time does not alter the tensor character. Since
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> is an invariant (tensor of rank 0), <img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 8.356ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/105.svg" alt=" " data-tex="(m\dfrac{d^{2} x_{\nu}}{dt^{2}}">)
is a vector, or
tensor of rank 1 (by the theorem of the multiplication of tensors).
If the force (<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.909ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{\nu}">) has a vector character, the same holds for
the difference (<img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 14.031ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/107.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m\dfrac{d^{2} x_{\nu}}{dt^{2}} - X_{\nu})">. These equations of motion are
therefore valid in every other system of Cartesian co-ordinates
in the space of reference. In the case where the forces are conservative
we can easily recognize the vector character of (<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.909ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{\nu}">).
For a potential energy, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.633ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/108.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Phi">, exists, which depends only upon the
mutual distances of the particles, and is therefore an invariant.
The vector character of the force, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.909ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{\nu}"> = <img style="vertical-align: -1.891ex; width: 6.366ex; height: 5.038ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="-\dfrac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x_{\nu}}">,
is then a consequence of our general theorem about the derivative of a tensor
of rank 0.
</p>
<p>
Multiplying by the velocity, a tensor of rank 1, we obtain the
tensor equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 25.76ex; height: 5.564ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\left(m\frac{d^{2} x_{\nu}}{dt^{2}} - X_{\nu}\right) \frac{dx_{\nu}}{dt} = 0.
"></span>
By contraction and multiplication by the scalar <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.993ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dt"> we obtain the
equation of kinetic energy
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 20.636ex; height: 5.564ex;" src="images/111.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
</p>
<p>
If <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.027ex; height: 2.057ex;" src="images/64.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\xi_{\nu}"> denotes the difference of the co-ordinates of the material
particle and a point fixed in space, then the <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.027ex; height: 2.057ex;" src="images/64.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\xi_{\nu}"> have the
character of vectors. We evidently have
<img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 5.489ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/103.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{d^{2} x_{\nu}}{dt^{2}}"> = <img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 5.186ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/112.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{d^{2} \xi_{\nu}}{dt^{2}}">, so that
the equations of motion of the particle may be written
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 17.625ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/113.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
m\frac{d^{2} \xi_{\nu}}{dt^{2}} - X_{\nu} = 0.
"></span>
</p>
<p>
Multiplying this equation by <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 2.143ex; height: 2.278ex;" src="images/74.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\xi_{\mu}"> we obtain a tensor equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 23.098ex; height: 5.564ex;" src="images/114.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\left(m\frac{d^{2} \xi_{\nu}}{dt^{2}} - X_{\nu}\right) \xi_{\mu} = 0.
"></span>
</p>
<p>
Contracting the tensor on the left and taking the time average
we obtain the virial theorem, which we shall not consider
further. By interchanging the indices and subsequent subtraction,
we obtain, after a simple transformation, the theorem of
moments,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 51.585ex; height: 5.467ex;" src="images/115.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{d}{dt} \biggl[
  m \biggl(\xi_{\mu} \frac{d\xi_{\nu}}{dt} - \xi_{\nu} \frac{d\xi_{\mu}}{dt}\biggr)\biggr]
= \xi_{\mu} X_{\nu} - \xi_{\nu} X_{\mu}.
\qquad\text{(15)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
It is evident in this way that the moment of a vector is not a
vector but a tensor. On account of their skew-symmetrical character
there are not nine, but only three independent equations of
this system. The possibility of replacing skew-symmetrical tensors
of the second rank in space of three dimensions by vectors
depends upon the formation of the vector
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 16.145ex; height: 4.588ex;" src="images/116.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
A_{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} A_{\sigma\tau} \delta_{\sigma\tau\mu}.
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
</p>
<p>
If we multiply the skew-symmetrical tensor of rank 2 by the
special skew-symmetrical tensor <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.005ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/117.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta"> introduced above, and contract
twice, a vector results whose components are numerically
equal to those of the tensor. These are the so-called axial vectors
which transform differently, from a right-handed system to
a left-handed system, from the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.214ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/61.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{\nu}">. There is a gain in
picturesqueness in regarding a skew-symmetrical tensor of rank 2
as a vector in space of three dimensions, but it does not represent
the exact nature of the corresponding quantity so well as
considering it a tensor.
</p>
<p>
We consider next the equations of motion of a continuous

We must show that this equation holds independently of the

is a tensor of rank 3. The second term on the left
results from contraction in the indices <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau">. The vector character
of the second term on the right is obvious. In order that the first
term on the right may also be a vector it is necessary for <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 3.087ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/120.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p_{\nu\sigma}"> to be
a tensor. Then by differentiation and contraction <img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 5.363ex; height: 5.056ex;" src="images/129.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\partial p_{\nu\sigma}}{\partial x_{\sigma}}"> results,
and is therefore a vector, as it also is after multiplication by
the reciprocal scalar <img style="vertical-align: -2.041ex; width: 2.165ex; height: 5.077ex;" src="images/130.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{\rho}">.

is proved in mechanics by integrating this equation over an infinitely
small tetrahedron. It is also proved there, by application
of the theorem of moments to an infinitely small parallelopipedon,
that <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 9.191ex; height: 1.758ex;" src="images/132.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p_{\nu\sigma} = p_{\sigma\nu}">, and hence that the tensor of the stress is
a symmetrical tensor. From what has been said it follows that,
with the aid of the rules given above, the equation is co-variant
with respect to orthogonal transformations in space (rotational
transformations); and the rules according to which the quantities
in the equation must be transformed in order that the
equation may be co-variant also become evident.

We shall also test for co-variance the equations which express
the dependence of the stress components upon the properties of

viscous fluid with the aid of the conditions of co-variance.

will depend only upon the density and the temperature of the
fluid. The contribution to the stress tensor is then evidently

also be present in the case of a viscous fluid. But in this case
there will also be pressure terms, which depend upon the space

linear one. Since these terms must be symmetrical tensors, the

physical reasons (no slipping) it

THE THEORY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY</h2>

<p class="nind">
<span class="dropcap">T</span>HE previous considerations concerning the configuration of
rigid bodies have been founded, irrespective of the assumption
as to the validity of the Euclidean geometry, upon the hypothesis
that all directions in space, or all configurations of Cartesian systems
of co-ordinates, are physically equivalent. We may express
this as the "principle of relativity with respect to direction," and
it has been shown how equations (laws of nature) may be found,
in accord with this principle, by the aid of the calculus of tensors.
We now inquire whether there is a relativity with respect
to the state of motion of the space of reference; in other words,
whether there are spaces of reference in motion relatively to each
other which are physically equivalent. From the standpoint of
mechanics it appears that equivalent spaces of reference do exist.
For experiments upon the earth tell us nothing of the fact
that we are moving about the sun with a velocity of approximately
30 kilometres a second. On the other hand, this physical
equivalence does not seem to hold for spaces of reference in arbitrary
motion; for mechanical effects do not seem to be subject
to the same laws in a jolting railway train as in one moving with
uniform velocity; the rotation of the earth must be considered
in writing down the equations of motion relatively to the earth.
It appears, therefore, as if there were Cartesian systems of co-ordinates,
the so-called inertial systems, with reference to which
the laws of mechanics (more generally the laws of physics) are
expressed in the simplest form. We may infer the validity of
the following theorem: If <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> is an inertial system, then every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
other system <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' which moves uniformly and without rotation
relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, is also an inertial system; the laws of nature are
in concordance for all inertial systems. This statement we shall
call the "principle of special relativity." We shall draw certain
conclusions from this principle of "relativity of translation" just
as we have already done for relativity of direction.
</p>
<p>
In order to be able to do this, we must first solve the following
problem. If we are given the Cartesian co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}">, and
the time, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">, of an event relatively to one inertial system, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">,
how can we calculate the co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.559ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 2.276ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x'_{\nu}">, and the time, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">', of
the same event relatively to an inertial system <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' which moves
with uniform translation relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">? In the pre-relativity
physics this problem was solved by making unconsciously two
hypotheses:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. The time is absolute; the time of an event, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">', relatively
to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' is the same as the time relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">. If instantaneous
signals could be sent to a distance, and if one knew that the
state of motion of a clock had no influence on its rate, then this
assumption would be physically established. For then clocks,
similar to one another, and regulated alike, could be distributed
over the systems <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">', at rest relatively to them, and their
indications would be independent of the state of motion of the
systems; the time of an event would then be given by the clock
in its immediate neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
2. Length is absolute; if an interval, at rest relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">,
has a length <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s">, then it has the same length <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s"> relatively to a
system <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' which is in motion relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">.

This transformation is known as the "Galilean Transformation."
Differentiating twice by the time, we get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 15.253ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/158.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{d^{2} {x'}_{\nu}}{dt^{2}} = \frac{d^{2} x_{\nu}}{dt^{2}}.
"></span>
Further, it follows that for two simultaneous events,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 28.681ex; height: 2.752ex;" src="images/159.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{{x'}_{\nu}}^{(1)} - {{x'}_{\nu}}^{(2)} = {x_{\nu}}^{(1)} - {x_{\nu}}^{(2)}.
"></span>
The invariance of the distance between the two points results
from squaring and adding. From this easily follows the co-variance
of Newton's equations of motion with respect to the
Galilean transformation (21). Hence it follows that classical
mechanics is in accord with the principle of special relativity if
the two hypotheses respecting scales and clocks are made.
</p>
<p>
But this attempt to found relativity of translation upon the
Galilean transformation fails when applied to electromagnetic
phenomena. The Maxwell-Lorentz electromagnetic equations
are not co-variant with respect to the Galilean transformation.
In particular, we note, by (21), that a ray of light which referred
to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> has a velocity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c">, has a different velocity referred to  <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">',
depending upon its direction. The space of reference of  <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> is
therefore distinguished, with respect to its physical properties,
from all spaces of reference which are in motion relatively to it
(quiescent æther). But all experiments have shown that electromagnetic
and optical phenomena, relatively to the earth as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
body of reference, are not influenced by the translational velocity
of the earth. The most important of these experiments are
those of Michelson and Morley, which I shall assume are known.
The validity of the principle of special relativity can therefore
hardly be doubted.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the Maxwell-Lorentz equations have
proved their validity in the treatment of optical problems in
moving bodies. No other theory has satisfactorily explained the
facts of aberration, the propagation of light in moving bodies
(Fizeau), and phenomena observed in double stars (De Sitter).
The consequence of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations that in a
vacuum light is propagated with the velocity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c">, at least with respect
to a definite inertial system <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, must therefore be regarded
as proved. According to the principle of special relativity, we
must also assume the truth of this principle for every other
inertial system.
</p>
<p>
Before we draw any conclusions from these two principles
we must first review the physical significance of the concepts
"time" and "velocity." It follows from what has gone before, that
co-ordinates with respect to an inertial system are physically
defined by means of measurements and constructions with the
aid of rigid bodies. In order to measure time, we have supposed
a clock, <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.735ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="U">, present somewhere, at rest relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">. But
we cannot fix the time, by means of this clock, of an event
whose distance from the clock is not negligible; for there are no
"instantaneous signals" that we can use in order to compare the
time of the event with that of the clock. In order to complete the
definition of time we may employ the principle of the constancy
of the velocity of light in a vacuum. Let us suppose that we
place similar clocks at points of the system <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, at rest relatively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
to it, and regulated according to the following scheme. A ray
of light is sent out from one of the clocks, <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.138ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/162.svg" alt=" " data-tex="U_{m}">, at the instant
when it indicates the time <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.409ex; height: 1.773ex;" src="images/163.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{m}">, and travels through a vacuum a
distance <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.573ex; height: 1.357ex;" src="images/164.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{mn}">, to the clock <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.693ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/165.svg" alt=" " data-tex="U_{n}">; at the instant when this ray meets
the clock <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.693ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/165.svg" alt=" " data-tex="U_{n}"> the latter is set to indicate the time
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 1.964ex; height: 1.773ex;" src="images/166.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{n}"> = <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.409ex; height: 1.773ex;" src="images/163.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{m}"> + <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 4.568ex; height: 4.106ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{r_{mn}}{c}">.<a id="FNanchor_7_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light then states
that this adjustment of the clocks will not lead to contradictions.
With clocks so adjusted, we can assign the time to events which
take place near any one of them. It is essential to note that this
definition of time relates only to the inertial system <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, since
we have used a system of clocks at rest relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">. The
assumption which was made in the pre-relativity physics of the
absolute character of time (i.e. the independence of time of the
choice of the inertial system) does not follow at all from this
definition.

<div class="footnote">

<p>
The theory of relativity is often criticized for giving, without
justification, a central theoretical role to the propagation
of light, in that it founds the concept of time upon the law of
propagation of light. The situation, however, is somewhat as
follows. In order to give physical significance to the concept of
time, processes of some kind are required which enable relations
to be established between different places. It is immaterial what
kind of processes one chooses for such a definition of time. It
is advantageous, however, for the theory, to choose only those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
processes concerning which we know something certain. This
holds for the propagation of light <i>in vacuo</i> in a higher degree
than for any other process which could be considered, thanks to
the investigations of Maxwell and H. A. Lorentz.
</p>
<p>
From all of these considerations, space and time data have
a physically real, and not a mere fictitious, significance; in particular
this holds for all the relations in which co-ordinates and
time enter, e.g. the relations (21). There is, therefore, sense in
asking whether those equations are true or not, as well as in
asking what the true equations of transformation are by which
we pass from one inertial system <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> to another, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">', moving relatively
to it. It may be shown that this is uniquely settled by
means of the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light
and the principle of special relativity.
</p>
<p>
To this end we think of space and time physically defined
with respect to two inertial systems, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">', in the way that
has been shown. Further, let a ray of light pass from one point <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">
to another point <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> through a vacuum. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> is the measured
distance between the two points, then the propagation of light
must satisfy the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 9.982ex; height: 1.805ex;" src="images/173.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
r = c·\Delta t.
"></span>
</p>
<p>
If we square this equation, and express <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.912ex;" src="images/174.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r^{2}"> by the differences
of the co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.214ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/61.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{\nu}">, in place of this equation we can write
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.018ex; width: 31.976ex; height: 3.167ex;" src="images/175.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\sum (\Delta x_{\nu})^{2} - c^{2} \Delta t^{2} = 0. \qquad\text{(22)}
"></span>
This equation formulates the principle of the constancy of the
velocity of light relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">. It must hold whatever may be
the motion of the source which emits the ray of light.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
</p>
<p>
The same propagation of light may also be considered relatively
to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">', in which case also the principle of the constancy of
the velocity of light must be satisfied. Therefore, with respect
to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">', we have the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.018ex; width: 34.175ex; height: 3.167ex;" src="images/176.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\sum ({\Delta x'}_{\nu})^{2} - c^{2} \Delta t'^{2} = 0.
\qquad\text{(22a)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
Equations (22a) and (22) must be mutually consistent with
each other with respect to the transformation which transforms
from <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">'. A transformation which effects this we shall call
a "Lorentz transformation."
</p>
<p>
Before considering these transformations in detail we shall
make a few general remarks about space and time. In the pre-relativity
physics space and time were separate entities. Specifications
of time were independent of the choice of the space of
reference. The Newtonian mechanics was relative with respect
to the space of reference, so that, e.g. the statement that two
non-simultaneous events happened at the same place had no objective
meaning (that is, independent of the space of reference).
But this relativity had no role in building up the theory. One
spoke of points of space, as of instants of time, as if they were
absolute realities. It was not observed that the true element
of the space-time specification was the event, specified by the
four numbers <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{3}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">. The conception of something
happening was always that of a four-dimensional continuum; but
the recognition of this was obscured by the absolute character
of the pre-relativity time. Upon giving up the hypothesis of the
absolute character of time, particularly that of simultaneity, the
four-dimensionality of the time-space concept was immediately
recognized. It is neither the point in space, nor the instant in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
time, at which something happens that has physical reality, but
only the event itself. There is no absolute (independent of the
space of reference) relation in space, and no absolute relation
in time between two events, but there is an absolute (independent
of the space of reference) relation in space and time, as
will appear in the sequel. The circumstance that there is no
objective rational division of the four-dimensional continuum
into a three-dimensional space and a one-dimensional time continuum
indicates that the laws of nature will assume a form
which is logically most satisfactory when expressed as laws in
the four-dimensional space-time continuum. Upon this depends
the great advance in method which the theory of relativity owes
to Minkowski. Considered from this standpoint, we must regard
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{3}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t"> as the four co-ordinates of an event in the
four-dimensional continuum. We have far less success in picturing
to ourselves relations in this four-dimensional continuum than
in the three-dimensional Euclidean continuum; but it must be
emphasized that even in the Euclidean three-dimensional geometry
its concepts and relations are only of an abstract nature in
our minds, and are not at all identical with the images we form
visually and through our sense of touch. The non-divisibility of
the four-dimensional continuum of events does not at all, however,
involve the equivalence of the space co-ordinates with the
time co-ordinate. On the contrary, we must remember that the
time co-ordinate is defined physically wholly differently from the
space co-ordinates. The relations (22) and (22a) which when
equated define the Lorentz transformation show, further, a difference
in the role of the time co-ordinate from that of the space
co-ordinates; for the term <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 3.689ex; height: 1.912ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta t^{2}"> has the opposite sign to the space
terms, <img style="vertical-align: -0.651ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 2.538ex;" src="images/178.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{1}^{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.651ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 2.538ex;" src="images/179.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{2}^{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 2.572ex;" src="images/180.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{3}^{2}">.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
</p>
<p>
Before we analyse further the conditions which define the
Lorentz transformation, we shall introduce the light-time, <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.488ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/181.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l = ct">,
in place of the time, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">, in order that the constant <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> shall not
enter explicitly into the formulas to be developed later. Then
the Lorentz transformation is defined in such a way that, first,
it makes the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 41.26ex; height: 2.633ex;" src="images/182.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{\Delta x_{1}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{2}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{3}}^{2} - \Delta l^{2} = 0
\qquad\text{(22b)}
"></span>
a co-variant equation, that is, an equation which is satisfied with
respect to every inertial system if it is satisfied in the inertial
system to which we refer the two given events (emission and
reception of the ray of light). Finally, with Minkowski, we introduce
in place of the real time co-ordinate <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.488ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/181.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l = ct">, the imaginary
time co-ordinate
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 25.618ex; height: 2.754ex;" src="images/183.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
x_{4} = il = ict\quad (\sqrt{-1} = i).
"></span>
Then the equation defining the propagation of light, which must
be co-variant with respect to the Lorentz transformation, becomes
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -3.222ex; width: 55.106ex; height: 5.371ex;" src="images/184.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\sum_{(4)} {\Delta x_{\nu}}^{2}
  = {\Delta x_{1}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{2}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{3}}^{2} + {\Delta x_{4}}^{2}
  = 0.
\qquad\text{(22c)}
"></span>
This condition is always satisfied<a id="FNanchor_8_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> if we satisfy the more general
condition that
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 42.527ex; height: 2.633ex;" src="images/185.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
shall be an invariant with respect to the transformation. This
condition is satisfied only by linear transformations, that is,
transformations of the type
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 25.407ex; height: 2.515ex;" src="images/186.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

in which the summation over the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> is to be extended from <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> = 1
to <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> = 4. A glance at equations (23) and (24) shows that the
Lorentz transformation so defined is identical with the translational
and rotational transformations of the Euclidean geometry,
if we disregard the number of dimensions and the relations of reality.
We can also conclude that the coefficients <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.147ex; height: 2.255ex;" src="images/90.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b_{\mu\alpha}"> must satisfy

<i>Special Lorentz Transformation</i>. We obtain the simplest

1 and 2, on account of the three independent conditions which
the relations (25) furnish,

in space (without the time transformation) which we studied
before is contained in the Lorentz transformation as a special
case. For the indices 1 and 4 we obtain, in an analogous manner,

These equations form the well-known special Lorentz transformation,
which in the general theory represents a rotation,
through an imaginary angle, of the four-dimensional system of
co-ordinates. If we introduce the ordinary time <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">, in place of the
light-time <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.674ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/199.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l">, then in (29) we must replace <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.674ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/199.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l"> by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.796ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/206.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ct"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/200.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v"> by
<img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 2.093ex; height: 4.109ex;" src="images/207.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{v}{c}">.
</p>
<p>
We must now fill in a gap. From the principle of the constancy
of the velocity of light it follows that the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.018ex; width: 12.994ex; height: 3.167ex;" src="images/208.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\sum {\Delta x_{\nu}}^{2} = 0
"></span>
has a significance which is independent of the choice of the inertial
system; but the invariance of the quantity <img style="vertical-align: -0.559ex; width: 4.214ex; height: 2.446ex;" src="images/209.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{\nu}^{2}"> does
not at all follow from this. This quantity might be transformed
with a factor. This depends upon the fact that the right-hand
side of (29) might be multiplied by a factor <img style="vertical-align: -0.027ex; width: 1.319ex; height: 1.597ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda">, independent of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/200.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">.
But the principle of relativity does not permit this factor to be
different from 1, as we shall now show. Let us assume that we
have a rigid circular cylinder moving in the direction of its axis.
If its radius, measured at rest with a unit measuring rod is equal
to <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.705ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/210.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R_{0}">, its radius <img style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/211.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R"> in motion, might be different from <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.705ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/210.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R_{0}">, since
the theory of relativity does not make the assumption that the
shape of bodies with respect to a space of reference is independent
of their motion relatively to this space of reference. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
all directions in space must be equivalent to each other. <img style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/211.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R"> may
therefore depend upon the magnitude <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.041ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/212.svg" alt=" " data-tex="q"> of the velocity, but not
upon its direction; <img style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/211.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R"> must therefore be an even function of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.041ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/212.svg" alt=" " data-tex="q">. If
the cylinder is at rest relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' the equation of its lateral
surface is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 15.362ex; height: 2.464ex;" src="images/213.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
x'^{2} + y'^{2} = {R_{0}}^{2}.
"></span>
If we write the last two equations of (29) more generally
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.17ex; width: 10.156ex; height: 5.47ex;" src="images/214.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\begin{align*}
{x'}_{2} = \lambda x_{2}, \\
{x'}_{3} = \lambda x_{3},
\end{align*}
"></span>
then the lateral surface of the cylinder referred to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> satisfies the
equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.656ex; width: 15.478ex; height: 5.179ex;" src="images/215.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
x^{2} + y^{2} = \frac{{R_{0}}^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}.
"></span>
The factor <img style="vertical-align: -0.027ex; width: 1.319ex; height: 1.597ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda"> therefore measures the lateral contraction of the
cylinder, and can thus, from the above, be only an even function
of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/200.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">.
</p>
<p>
If we introduce a third system of co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"><code>"</code>, which
moves relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' with velocity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/200.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v"> in the direction of the
negative <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/216.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x">-axis of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, we obtain, by applying (29) twice,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -5.244ex; width: 19.39ex; height: 11.62ex;" src="images/217.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\begin{align*}
{x''}_{1} &= \lambda(v) \lambda(-v) x_{1}, \\
{x''}_{2} &= \lambda(v) \lambda(-v) x_{2}, \\
{x''}_{3} &= \lambda(v) \lambda(-v) x_{3}, \\
l'' &= \lambda(v) \lambda(-v) l.
\end{align*}
"></span>
Now, since <img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 4.176ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/218.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda(v)"> must be equal to <img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 5.937ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/219.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda(-v)"> and since we assume
that we use the same measuring rods in all the systems, it follows
that the transformation of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"><code>"</code> to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> must be the identical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
transformation (since the possibility <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 7.228ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda = -1"> does not need to
be considered). It is essential for these considerations to assume
that the behaviour of the measuring rods does not depend upon
the history of their previous motion.

this follows from the second of equations (29) and shows that
the clock goes slower than if it were at rest relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">'.
These two consequences, which hold, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, for every

<i>General Statements about the Lorentz Transformation and

Formally, it has the same rôle in the four-dimensional space-time
continuum as the invariant
<img style="vertical-align: -0.651ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 2.538ex;" src="images/178.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{1}^{2}"> + <img style="vertical-align: -0.651ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 2.538ex;" src="images/179.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{2}^{2}"> + <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 2.572ex;" src="images/180.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{3}^{2}"> in the Euclidean
geometry and in the pre-relativity physics. The latter quantity
is not an invariant with respect to all the Lorentz transformations;
the quantity <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/230.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s^{2}"> of equation (23) assumes the rôle of this
invariant. With respect to an arbitrary inertial system, <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/230.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s^{2}"> may
be determined by measurements; with a given unit of measure
it is a completely determinate quantity, associated with an arbitrary
pair of events.

The invariant <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/230.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s^{2}"> differs, disregarding the number of dimensions,
from the corresponding invariant of the Euclidean geometry
in the following points. In the Euclidean geometry <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/230.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s^{2}"> is
necessarily positive; it vanishes only when the two points concerned
come together. On the other hand, from the vanishing
of

it cannot be concluded that the two space-time points fall together;
the vanishing of this quantity <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/230.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s^{2}">, is the invariant condition

A physical entity which is specified by four quantities, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.733ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/238.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\nu}">,
in an arbitrary inertial system of the

a 4-vector, with the components <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.733ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/238.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\nu}">, if the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.733ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/238.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\nu}"> correspond in
their relations of reality and the properties of transformation to
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.214ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/61.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{\nu}">; it may be of the nature of a space or of a time. The
sixteen quantities <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.697ex; height: 2.305ex;" src="images/240.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\mu\nu}">, then form the components of a tensor of
the second rank, if they transform according to the scheme
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 17.844ex; height: 2.515ex;" src="images/241.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{A'}_{\mu\nu} = b_{\mu\alpha} b_{\nu\beta} A_{\alpha\beta}.
"></span>
It follows from this that the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.697ex; height: 2.305ex;" src="images/240.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\mu\nu}"> behave, with respect to
their properties of transformation and their properties of reality,
as the products of components, <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 5.052ex; height: 2.23ex;" src="images/242.svg" alt=" " data-tex="U_{\mu}V_{\nu}"> of two 4-vectors,
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.735ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="U">) and (<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.74ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/52.svg" alt=" " data-tex="V">). All the components are real except those which
contain the index 4 once, those being purely imaginary. Tensors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of the third and higher ranks may be defined in an analogous
way. The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
contraction and differentiation for these tensors are wholly
analogous to the corresponding operations for tensors in three-dimensional space.
</p>
<p>
Before we apply the tensor theory to the four-dimensional
space-time continuum, we shall examine more particularly the
skew-symmetrical tensors. The tensor of the second rank has, in
general, 16 = 4·4 components. In the case of skew-symmetry the
components with two equal indices vanish, and the components
with unequal indices are equal and opposite in pairs. There
exist, therefore, only six independent components, as is the case
in the electromagnetic field. In fact, it will be shown when we
consider Maxwell's equations that these may be looked upon as
tensor equations, provided we regard the electromagnetic field
as a skew-symmetrical tensor. Further, it is clear that the skew-symmetrical
tensor of the third rank (skew-symmetrical in all
pairs of indices) has only four independent components, since
there are only four combinations of three different indices.
</p>
<p>
We now turn to Maxwell's equations (19a), (19b), (20a),
(20b), and introduce the notation:<a id="FNanchor_10_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>

\end{gather*}

as one can easily verify by substituting from (30a) and (31).
Equations (32) and (33) have a tensor character, and are
therefore co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations,
if the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.349ex; height: 2.255ex;" src="images/244.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi_{\mu\nu}"> and the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.291ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/247.svg" alt=" " data-tex="J_{\nu}"> have a tensor character, which we assume.
Consequently, the laws for transforming these quantities from
one to another allowable (inertial) system of co-ordinates are
uniquely determined. The progress in method which electrodynamics
owes to the theory of special relativity lies principally
in this, that the number of independent hypotheses is diminished.
If we consider, for example, equations (19a) only from the
standpoint of relativity of direction, as we have done above, we
see that they have three logically independent terms. The way
in which the electric intensity enters these equations appears to
be wholly independent of the way in which the magnetic intensity
enters them; it would not be surprising if instead of
<img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 4.483ex; height: 4.945ex;" src="images/248.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\partial e_{\mu}}{\partial l}">,
we had, say,
<img style="vertical-align: -1.679ex; width: 5.588ex; height: 5.291ex;" src="images/249.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\partial^{2} e_{\mu}}{\partial l^{2}}">
or if this term were absent. On the other
hand, only two independent terms appear in equation (32). The
electromagnetic field appears as a formal unit; the way in which
the electric field enters this equation is determined by the way in
which the magnetic field enters it. Besides the electromagnetic
field, only the electric current density appears as an independent
entity. This advance in method arises from the fact that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
electric and magnetic fields draw their separate existences from
the relativity of motion. A field which appears to be purely an
electric field, judged from one system, has also magnetic field
components when judged from another inertial system. When
applied to an electromagnetic field, the general law of transformation
furnishes, for the special case of the special Lorentz
transformation, the equations

field <img style="vertical-align: -0.014ex; width: 1.192ex; height: 1.036ex;" src="images/146.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mathbf e"> as well, which would act upon an electric particle at rest

designate this force as the Biot-Savart force, or the Lorentz electromotive
force. It therefore appears as if this electromotive force
had become fused with the electric field intensity into a single
entity.
</p>
<p>
In order to view this relation formally, let us consider the
expression for the force acting upon unit volume of electricity,

If we introduce <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 2.408ex; height: 2.23ex;" src="images/254.svg" alt=" " data-tex="J_{\mu}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.349ex; height: 2.255ex;" src="images/244.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi_{\mu\nu}"> according to
(30a) and (31), we obtain for the first component the expression

There is, therefore, a four-dimensional vector of force per unit
volume, whose first three components, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.908ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/261.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.908ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/262.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.908ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/263.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{3}">, are
the ponderomotive force components per unit volume, and whose fourth
component is the rate of working of the field per unit volume,
multiplied by <img style="vertical-align: -0.318ex; width: 4.821ex; height: 2.398ex;" src="images/264.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sqrt{-1}">.

A comparison of (36) and (35) shows that the theory of relativity

integral extended over the shaded portion transforms as a 4-vector,
as does also the integral between the limits <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.662ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/269.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{1}"> and  <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.662ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/270.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{2}">, because
the portion of the region which is not shaded contributes nothing
to the integral. It follows, therefore, that

to an instantaneous condition of the body (e.g. at the time <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.674ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/199.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l"> = <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.662ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/269.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{1}">).

and the velocity of the body, considered as a material particle.
To form this expression, we note first, that

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
is an invariant which refers to an infinitely short portion of the
four-dimensional line which represents the motion of the material
particle. The physical significance of the invariant <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 2.346ex; height: 1.6ex;" src="images/280.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d \tau"> may
easily be given. If the time axis is chosen in such a way that it
has the direction of the line differential which we are considering,
or, in other words, if we reduce the material particle to rest,
we shall then have <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 7.214ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/281.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d \tau = dl">; this will therefore be measured by
the light-seconds clock which is at the same place, and at rest
relatively to the material particle. We therefore call <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> the proper

(<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.395ex; height: 1.357ex;" src="images/284.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u_{\sigma}">) as the four-dimensional vector (in brief, 4-vector) of
velocity. Its components satisfy, by (38), the condition

is the only 4-vector which can be formed from the velocity components
of the material particle which are defined in three dimensions by

"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
We therefore see that

\qquad \text{(42)}

must be that 4-vector which is to be equated to the 4-vector of
momentum and energy whose existence we have proved above.
By equating the components, we obtain, in three-dimensional
notation,

E = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - q^{2}}}.

<p>
We recognize, in fact, that these components of momentum
agree with those of classical mechanics for velocities which are
small compared to that of light. For large velocities the momentum
increases more rapidly than linearly with the velocity, so as
to become infinite on approaching the velocity of light.
</p>
<p>
If we apply the last of equations (43) to a material particle
at rest (<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.041ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/212.svg" alt=" " data-tex="q"> = 0), we see that the energy, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.657ex; height: 1.913ex;" src="images/290.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E_{0}"> of a, body at rest is
equal to its mass. Had we chosen the second as our unit of time,
we would have obtained

E_{0} = mc^{2}.
  \qquad \text{(44)}
"></span>
Mass and energy are therefore essentially alike; they are only
different expressions for the same thing. The mass of a body
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
is not a constant; it varies with changes in its energy.<a id="FNanchor_11_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
We see from the last of equations (43) that <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/292.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> becomes infinite when
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.041ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/212.svg" alt=" " data-tex="q"> approaches 1, the velocity of light. If we develop <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/292.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> in powers
of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 2.143ex; height: 2.326ex;" src="images/293.svg" alt=" " data-tex="q^{2}">, we obtain,

We conclude from (48) that the energy tensor of the electromagnetic
field is symmetrical; with this is connected the fact
that the momentum per unit volume and the how of energy are
equal to each other (relation between energy and inertia).
</p>
<p>
We therefore conclude from these considerations that the
energy per unit volume has the character of a tensor. This has
been proved directly only for an electromagnetic field, although
we may claim universal validity for it. Maxwell's equations determine
the electromagnetic field when the distribution of electric
charges and currents is known. But we do not know the
laws which govern the currents and charges. We do know, indeed,
that electricity consists of elementary particles (electrons,
positive nuclei), but from a theoretical point of view we cannot
comprehend this. We do not know the energy factors which
determine the distribution of electricity in particles of definite
size and charge, and all attempts to complete the theory in this
direction have failed. If then we can build upon Maxwell's equations
in general, the energy tensor of the electromagnetic field
is known only outside the charged particles.<a id="FNanchor_13_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In these regions,

<i>General Expressions for the Conservation Principles</i>. We
can hardly avoid making the assumption that in all other cases,
also, the space distribution of energy is given by a symmetrical
tensor, <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.322ex; height: 2.217ex;" src="images/310.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{\mu\nu}">, and that this complete energy tensor everywhere
satisfies the relation (47c). At any rate we shall see that by
means of this assumption we obtain the correct expression for
the integral energy principle.

Let us consider a spatially bounded, closed system, which,
four-dimensionally, we may represent as a strip, outside of which
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.322ex; height: 2.217ex;" src="images/310.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{\mu\nu}"> vanish. Integrate equation (47c) over a space section.

vanish because
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.322ex; height: 2.217ex;" src="images/310.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{\mu\nu}"> vanish at the limits of integration, we obtain

principles in their integral form. That this gives the right conception
of energy and the conservation principles will be seen

PHENOMENOLOGICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE

<p>
<i>Hydrodynamical Equations</i>. We know that matter is built
up of electrically charged particles, but we do not know the laws
which govern the constitution of these particles. In treating mechanical
problems, we are therefore obliged to make use of an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
inexact description of matter, which corresponds to that of classical
mechanics. The density <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma">, of a material substance and the
hydrodynamical pressures are the fundamental concepts upon
which such a description is based.

Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.28ex; height: 1.35ex;" src="images/316.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma_{0}"> be the density of matter at a place, estimated with

Then <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.28ex; height: 1.35ex;" src="images/316.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma_{0}">, the density at rest, is an invariant. If we think of the
matter in arbitrary motion and neglect the pressures (particles

(equal to the negative energy per unit volume), as it should,
according to the theorem of the equivalence of mass and energy,
and according to the physical interpretation of the energy tensor
given above. If an external force (four-dimensional vector, <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.073ex; height: 2.23ex;" src="images/265.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{\mu}">)

must hold. We shall now show that this equation leads to the
same law of motion of a material particle as that already obtained.
Let us imagine the matter to be of infinitely small extent
in space, that is, a four-dimensional thread; then by integration
over the whole thread with respect to the space co-ordinates
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{3}">, we obtain

Now <img style="vertical-align: -0.691ex; width: 16.724ex; height: 2.514ex;" src="images/323.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\int dx_{1}\, dx_{2}\, dx_{3}\, dx_{4}"> is an invariant, as is, therefore, also

We shall calculate this integral, first with
respect to the inertial system which we have chosen, and second,
with respect to a system relatively to which the matter has the
velocity zero. The integration is to be extended over a filament
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
of the thread for which <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.28ex; height: 1.35ex;" src="images/316.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma_{0}"> may be regarded as constant over the
whole section. If the space volumes of the filament referred to
the two systems are <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.916ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/325.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dV"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 3.483ex; height: 1.945ex;" src="images/326.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dV_{0}"> respectively, then we have

and therefore also

</p>
<p>
If we substitute the right-hand side for the left-hand side in
the former integral, and put <img style="vertical-align: -1.581ex; width: 4.454ex; height: 4.681ex;" src="images/329.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{dx_{1}}{d\tau}"> outside the sign of integration,
we obtain,

"></span>
We see, therefore, that the generalized conception of the energy
tensor is in agreement with our former result.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>The Eulerian Equations for Perfect Fluids</i>. In order to get
nearer to the behaviour of real matter we must add to the energy
tensor a term which corresponds to the pressures. The simplest
case is that of a perfect fluid in which the pressure is determined
by a scalar <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.138ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p">. Since the tangential stresses <img style="vertical-align: -0.667ex; width: 3.025ex; height: 1.667ex;" src="images/331.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p_{xy}">, etc., vanish in
this case, the contribution to the energy tensor must be of the
form <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 4.143ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/332.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p\delta_{\nu\mu}">. We must therefore put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 28.869ex; height: 2.382ex;" src="images/333.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
T_{\mu\nu} = \sigma u_{\mu} u_{\nu} + p\delta_{\mu\nu}.
\qquad \text{(51)}
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
At rest, the density of the matter, or the energy per unit volume,
is in this case, not <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma"> but <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 5.196ex; height: 1.758ex;" src="images/334.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma - p">. For
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.581ex; width: 35.761ex; height: 4.681ex;" src="images/335.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
-T_{44} = -\sigma \frac{dx_{4}}{d\tau}\, \frac{dx_{4}}{d\tau} - p\delta_{44}
  = \sigma - p.
"></span>
In the absence of any force, we have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 42.095ex; height: 5.58ex;" src="images/336.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{\partial T_{\mu\nu}}{\partial x_{\nu}}
  = \sigma u_{\nu} \frac{\partial u_{\mu}}{\partial x_{\nu}}
  + u_{\mu} \frac{\partial (\sigma u_{\nu})}{\partial x_{\nu}}
  + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{\mu}} = 0.
"></span>
If we multiply this equation by <img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 13.161ex; height: 5.444ex;" src="images/337.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u_{\mu} \left(= \dfrac{dx_{\mu}}{d\tau}\right)">
and sum for the <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu">'s we obtain, using (40),
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.891ex; width: 29.227ex; height: 5.195ex;" src="images/338.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
-\frac{\partial (\sigma u_{\nu})}{\partial x_{\nu}} + \frac{dp}{d\tau} = 0,
\qquad \text{(52)}
"></span>
where we have put <img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 16.078ex; height: 5.533ex;" src="images/339.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial x_{\mu}}\, \dfrac{dx_{\mu}}{d\tau} = \dfrac{dp}{d\tau}">.
This is the equation of continuity, which differs from that of
classical mechanics by the term <img style="vertical-align: -1.581ex; width: 3.342ex; height: 4.681ex;" src="images/340.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{dp}{d\tau}">, which, practically,
is vanishingly small. Observing (52), the conservation principles take the form
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 35.277ex; height: 5.533ex;" src="images/341.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\sigma \frac{du_{\mu}}{d\tau}
  + u_{\mu} \frac{dp}{d\tau}
  + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{\mu}} = 0.
\qquad \text{(53)}
"></span>
The equations for the first three indices evidently correspond to
the Eulerian equations. That the equations (52) and (53) correspond,
to a first approximation, to the hydrodynamical equations
of classical mechanics, is a further confirmation of the generalized
energy principle. The density of matter and of energy
has the character of a symmetrical tensor.

<h2 title="LECTURE III: THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY"><a id="chap03"></a>LECTURE III
<br><br>
THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY</h2>

<p class="nind">
<span class="dropcap">A</span>LL of the previous considerations have been based upon the
assumption that all inertial systems are equivalent for the description
of physical phenomena, but that they are preferred, for
the formulation of the laws of nature, to spaces of reference in a
different state of motion. We can think of no cause for this preference
for definite states of motion to all others, according to our
previous considerations, either in the perceptible bodies or in the
concept of motion; on the contrary, it must be regarded as an independent
property of the space-time continuum. The principle
of inertia, in particular, seems to compel us to ascribe physically
objective properties to the space-time continuum. Just as
it was necessary from the Newtonian standpoint to make both
the statements, <i>tempus est absolutum</i>, <i>spatium est absolutum</i>, so
from the standpoint of the special theory of relativity we must
say, <i>continuum spatii et temporis est absolutum</i>. In this latter
statement <i>absolutum</i> means not only "physically real," but also
"independent in its physical properties, having a physical effect,
but not itself influenced by physical conditions."
</p>
<p>
As long as the principle of inertia is regarded as the keystone
of physics, this standpoint is certainly the only one which
is justified. But there are two serious criticisms of the ordinary
conception. In the first place, it is contrary to the mode of thinking
in science to conceive of a thing (the space-time continuum)
which acts itself, but which cannot be acted upon. This is the
reason why E. Mach was led to make the attempt to eliminate
space as an active cause in the system of mechanics. According
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
to him, a material particle does not move in unaccelerated
motion relatively to space, but relatively to the centre of all the
other masses in the universe; in this way the series of causes of
mechanical phenomena was closed, in contrast to the mechanics
of Newton and Galileo. In order to develop this idea within the
limits of the modern theory of action through a medium, the
properties of the space-time continuum which determine inertia
must be regarded as field properties of space, analogous to the
electromagnetic field. The concepts of classical mechanics afford
no way of expressing this. For this reason Mach's attempt
at a solution failed for the time being. We shall come back to
this point of view later. In the second place, classical mechanics
indicates a limitation which directly demands an extension of
the principle of relativity to spaces of reference which are not
in uniform motion relatively to each other. The ratio of the
masses of two bodies is defined in mechanics in two ways which
differ from each other fundamentally; in the first place, as the
reciprocal ratio of the accelerations which the same motional
force imparts to them (inert mass), and in the second place, as
the ratio of the forces which act upon them in the same gravitational
field (gravitational mass). The equality of these two
masses, so differently defined, is a fact which is confirmed by
experiments of very high accuracy (experiments of Eötvös), and
classical mechanics offers no explanation for this equality. It is,
however, clear that science is fully justified in assigning such a
numerical equality only after this numerical equality is reduced
to an equality of the real nature of the two concepts.
</p>
<p>
That this object may actually be attained by an extension
of the principle of relativity, follows from the following consideration.
A little reflection will show that the theorem of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
equality of the inert and the gravitational mass is equivalent
to the theorem that the acceleration imparted to a body by a
gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For
Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out
in full, is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.036ex; width: 69.485ex; height: 5.204ex;" src="images/342.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\begin{aligned}
(\text{Inert mass})·(\text{Acceleration}) = \,(\text{Intensity of the} \\
\qquad
  \text{gravitational field}) &· (\text{Gravitational mass}).
\end{aligned}
"></span>
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inert
and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of
the nature of the body. Let now <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> be an inertial system. Masses
which are sufficiently far from each other and from other bodies
are then, with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, free from acceleration. We shall
also refer these masses to a system of co-ordinates <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' uniformly
accelerated with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">. Relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' all the masses
have equal and parallel accelerations; with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' they
behave just as if a gravitational field were present and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' were
unaccelerated. Overlooking for the present the question as to the
"cause" of such a gravitational field, which will occupy us later,
there is nothing to prevent our conceiving this gravitational field
as real, that is, the conception that <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' is "at rest" and a gravitational
field is present we may consider as equivalent to the conception
that only <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> is an "allowable" system of co-ordinates and
no gravitational field is present. The assumption of the complete
physical equivalence of the systems of co-ordinates,
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">',
we call the "principle of equivalence;" this principle is evidently
intimately connected with the theorem of the equality between
the inert and the gravitational mass, and signifies an extension
of the principle of relativity to co-ordinate systems which are in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
non-uniform motion relatively to each other. In fact, through
this conception we arrive at the unity of the nature of inertia
and gravitation. For according to our way of looking at it, the
same masses may appear to be either under the action of inertia
alone (with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">) or under the combined action of
inertia and gravitation (with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">'). The possibility of
explaining the numerical equality of inertia and gravitation by
the unity of their nature gives to the general theory of relativity,
according to my conviction, such a superiority over the conceptions
of classical mechanics, that all the difficulties encountered
in development must be considered as small in comparison.
</p>
<p>
What justifies us in dispensing with the preference for inertial
systems over all other co-ordinate systems, a preference
that seems so securely established by experiment based upon
the principle of inertia? The weakness of the principle of inertia
lies in this, that it involves an argument in a circle: a mass moves
without acceleration if it is sufficiently far from other bodies; we
know that it is sufficiently far from other bodies only by the fact
that it moves without acceleration. Are there, in general, any
inertial systems for very extended portions of the space-time
continuum, or, indeed, for the whole universe? We may look
upon the principle of inertia as established, to a high degree of
approximation, for the space of our planetary system, provided
that we neglect the perturbations due to the sun and planets.
Stated more exactly, there are finite regions, where, with respect
to a suitably chosen space of reference, material particles move
freely without acceleration, and in which the laws of the special
theory of relativity, which have been developed above, hold
with remarkable accuracy. Such regions we shall call "Galilean
regions." We shall proceed from the consideration of such regions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
as a special case of known properties.
</p>
<p>
The principle of equivalence demands that in dealing with
Galilean regions we may equally well make use of non-inertial
systems, that is, such co-ordinate systems as, relatively to inertial
systems, are not free from acceleration and rotation. If,
further, we are going to do away completely with the difficult
question as to the objective reason for the preference of certain
systems of co-ordinates, then we must allow the use of arbitrarily
moving systems of co-ordinates. As soon as we make this
attempt seriously we come into conflict with that physical interpretation
of space and time to which we were led by the special
theory of relativity. For let <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' be a system of co-ordinates whose
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.052ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/252.svg" alt=" " data-tex="z">'-axis coincides with the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.052ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/252.svg" alt=" " data-tex="z">-axis of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, and which rotates about
the latter axis with constant angular velocity. Are the configurations
of rigid bodies, at rest relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">', in accordance with
the laws of Euclidean geometry? Since <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' is not an inertial system,
we do not know directly the laws of configuration of rigid
bodies with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">', nor the laws of nature, in general. But
we do know these laws with respect to the inertial system <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">,
and we can therefore estimate them with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">'. Imagine
a circle drawn about the origin in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 6.424ex; height: 2.181ex;" src="images/343.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x'-y'"> plane of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' and a
diameter of this circle. Imagine, further, that we have given a
large number of rigid rods, all equal to each other. We suppose
these laid in series along the periphery and the diameter of the
circle, at rest relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">'. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.735ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="U"> is the number of these rods
along the periphery, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.873ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/80.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D"> the number along the diameter, then, if
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' does not rotate relatively to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, we shall have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 7.804ex; height: 4.627ex;" src="images/344.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{U}{D} = \pi.
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
But if <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' rotates we get a different result. Suppose that at
a definite time <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t"> of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> we determine the ends of all the rods.
With respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> all the rods upon the periphery experience
the Lorentz contraction, but the rods upon the diameter do not
experience this contraction (along their lengths!).<a id="FNanchor_14_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_1" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
It therefore follows that
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 7.804ex; height: 4.627ex;" src="images/345.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{U}{D} > \pi.
"></span>
</p>
<p>
It therefore follows that the laws of configuration of rigid
bodies with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' do not agree with the laws of configuration
of rigid bodies that are in accordance with Euclidean geometry.
If, further, we place two similar clocks (rotating with <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">'),
one upon the periphery, and the other at the centre of the circle,
then, judged from <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, the clock on the periphery will go
slower than the clock at the centre. The same thing must take
place, judged from <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">', if we define time with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' in a
not wholly unnatural way, that is, in such a way that the laws
with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' depend explicitly upon the time. Space and
time, therefore, cannot be defined with respect to <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' as they
were in the special theory of relativity with respect to inertial
systems. But, according to the principle of equivalence, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">' is
also to be considered as a system at rest, with respect to which
there is a gravitational field (field of centrifugal force, and force
of Coriolis). We therefore arrive at the result: the gravitational
field influences and even determines the metrical laws of the
space-time continuum. If the laws of configuration of ideal rigid
bodies are to be expressed geometrically, then in the presence
of a gravitational field the geometry is not Euclidean.

<p>
The case that we have been considering is analogous to that
which is presented in the two-dimensional treatment of surfaces.
It is impossible in the latter case also, to introduce co-ordinates
on a surface (e.g. the surface of an ellipsoid) which
have a simple metrical significance, while on a plane the Cartesian
co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}">, signify directly lengths measured by a
unit measuring rod. Gauss overcame this difficulty, in his theory
of surfaces, by introducing curvilinear co-ordinates which,
apart from satisfying conditions of continuity, were wholly arbitrary,
and afterwards these co-ordinates were related to the
metrical properties of the surface. In an analogous way we
shall introduce in the general theory of relativity arbitrary co-ordinates,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{3}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/239.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{4}">, which shall number uniquely the space-time
points, so that neighbouring events are associated with
neighbouring values of the co-ordinates; otherwise, the choice
of co-ordinates is arbitrary. We shall be true to the principle
of relativity in its broadest sense if we give such a form to the
laws that they are valid in every such four-dimensional system
of co-ordinates, that is, if the equations expressing the laws are
co-variant with respect to arbitrary transformations.
</p>
<p>
The most important point of contact between Gauss's theory
of surfaces and the general theory of relativity lies in the metrical
properties upon which the concepts of both theories, in the
main, are based. In the case of the theory of surfaces, Gauss's
argument is as follows. Plane geometry may be based upon the
concept of the distance <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.238ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/346.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds">, between two indefinitely near points.
The concept of this distance is physically significant because
the distance can be measured directly by means of a rigid measuring
rod. By a suitable choice of Cartesian co-ordinates this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
distance may be expressed by the formula <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 17.9ex; height: 2.357ex;" src="images/347.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds^{2} = {dx_{1}}^{2} + {dx_{2}}^{2}">.
We may base upon this quantity the concepts of the straight
line as the geodesic (<img style="vertical-align: -0.691ex; width: 8.391ex; height: 2.514ex;" src="images/348.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta\! \int\!\! ds = 0">), the interval, the circle, and the
angle, upon which the Euclidean plane geometry is built. A
geometry may be developed upon another continuously curved
surface, if we observe that an infinitesimally small portion of the
surface may be regarded as plane, to within relatively infinitesimal
quantities. There are Cartesian co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/349.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/350.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{2}">, upon
such a small portion of the surface, and the distance between
two points, measured by a measuring rod, is given by
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 19.687ex; height: 2.357ex;" src="images/351.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ds^{2} = {dX_{1}}^{2} + {dX_{2}}^{2}.
"></span>
If we introduce arbitrary curvilinear co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{2}">, on the
surface, then <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.037ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/352.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dX_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.037ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/353.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dX_{2}">, may be expressed linearly in terms of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.458ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/354.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.458ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/355.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{2}">. Then everywhere upon the surface we have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 39.454ex; height: 2.482ex;" src="images/356.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ds^{2} = g_{11}\, {dx_{1}}^{2} + 2g_{12}\, dx_{1}\, dx_{2}
     + g_{22}\, {dx_{2}}^{2},
"></span>
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.867ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/357.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{11}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.867ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/358.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{12}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.867ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/359.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{22}"> are determined by the nature of the surface
and the choice of co-ordinates; if these quantities are known,
then it is also known how networks of rigid rods may be laid
upon the surface. In other words, the geometry of surfaces may
be based upon this expression for <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 3.225ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/360.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds^{2}"> exactly as plane geometry
is based upon the corresponding expression.
</p>
<p>
There are analogous relations in the four-dimensional space-time
continuum of physics. In the immediate neighbourhood of
an observer, falling freely in a gravitational field, there exists no
gravitational field. We can therefore always regard an infinitesimally
small region of the space-time continuum as Galilean.
For such an infinitely small region there will be an inertial system
(with the space co-ordinates, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/349.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/350.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/361.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{3}">, and the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
co-ordinate <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/362.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{4}">) relatively to which we are to regard the laws of
the special theory of relativity as valid. The quantity which is
directly measurable by our unit measuring rods and clocks,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 29.027ex; height: 2.457ex;" src="images/363.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{dX_{1}}^{2} + {dX_{2}}^{2} + {dX_{3}}^{2} - {dX_{4}}^{2},
"></span>
or its negative,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 45.954ex; height: 2.584ex;" src="images/364.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ds^{2} = -{dX_{1}}^{2} - {dX_{2}}^{2} - {dX_{3}}^{2} + {dX_{4}}^{2},
\qquad \text{(54)}
"></span>
is therefore a uniquely determinate invariant for two neighbouring
events (points in the four-dimensional continuum), provided
that we use measuring rods that are equal to each other when
brought together and superimposed, and clocks whose rates are
the same when they are brought together. In this the physical
assumption is essential that the relative lengths of two measuring
rods and the relative rates of two clocks are independent, in
principle, of their previous history. But this assumption is certainly
warranted by experience; if it did not hold there could be
no sharp spectral lines; for the single atoms of the same element
certainly do not have the same history, and it would be absurd
to suppose any relative difference in the structure of the single
atoms due to their previous history if the mass and frequencies
of the single atoms of the same element were always the same.
</p>
<p>
Space-time regions of finite extent are, in general, not
Galilean, so that a gravitational field cannot be done away
with by any choice of co-ordinates in a finite region. There
is, therefore, no choice of co-ordinates for which the metrical
relations of the special theory of relativity hold in a finite region.
But the invariant <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.238ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/346.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds"> always exists for two neighbouring
points (events) of the continuum. This invariant <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.238ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/346.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds"> may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
expressed in arbitrary co-ordinates. If one observes that the
local <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.085ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/365.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dX_{\nu}"> may be expressed linearly in terms of the co-ordinate
differentials <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.506ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\nu}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 3.225ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/360.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds^{2}"> may be expressed in the form
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 26.76ex; height: 2.685ex;" src="images/366.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ds^{2} = g_{\mu\nu}\, dx_{\mu}\, dx_{\nu}.
\qquad \text{(55)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
The functions <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> describe, with respect to the arbitrarily
chosen system of co-ordinates, the metrical relations of the
space-time continuum and also the gravitational field. As in
the special theory of relativity, we have to discriminate between
time-like and space-like line elements in the four-dimensional
continuum; owing to the change of sign introduced, time-like line
elements have a real, space-like line elements an imaginary <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.238ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/346.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds">.
The time-like <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.238ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/346.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds"> can be measured directly by a suitably chosen
clock.
</p>
<p>
According to what has been said, it is evident that the formulation
of the general theory of relativity assumes a generalization
of the theory of invariants and the theory of tensors; the question
is raised as to the form of the equations which are co-variant
with respect to arbitrary point transformations. The generalized
calculus of tensors was developed by mathematicians long before
the theory of relativity. Riemann first extended Gauss's
train of thought to continua of any number of dimensions; with
prophetic vision he saw the physical meaning of this generalization
of Euclid's geometry. Then followed the development of
the theory in the form of the calculus of tensors, particularly by
Ricci and Levi-Civita. This is the place for a brief presentation
of the most important mathematical concepts and operations of
this calculus of tensors.
</p>
<p>
We designate four quantities, which are defined as functions
of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}"> with respect to every system of co-ordinates, as components,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.733ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/368.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\nu}">, of a contra-variant vector, if they transform in a
change of co-ordinates as the co-ordinate differentials <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.506ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\nu}">. We
therefore have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.891ex; width: 24.13ex; height: 5.334ex;" src="images/369.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{{A'}^{\mu}} = \frac{{\partial x'}_{\mu}}{\partial x_{\nu}} A^{\nu}.
\qquad \text{(56)}
"></span>
Besides these contra-variant vectors, there are also co-variant
vectors. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.753ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/370.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B_{\nu}"> are the components of a co-variant vector, these
vectors are transformed according to the rule
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 24.171ex; height: 5.384ex;" src="images/371.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{B'}_{\mu} = \frac{\partial x_{\nu}}{{\partial {x'}}_{\mu}} B_{\nu}.
\qquad \text{(57)}
"></span>
The definition of a co-variant vector is chosen in such a way that
a co-variant vector and a contra-variant vector together form a
scalar according to the scheme,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 32.939ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/372.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\phi = B_{\nu} A^{\nu}\quad \text{(summed over the } \nu).
"></span>
Accordingly,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 35.894ex; height: 5.68ex;" src="images/373.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{B'}_{\mu} {{A'}^{\mu}}
  = \frac{\partial x_{\alpha}}{{\partial x'}_{\mu}}
    \frac{{\partial x'}_{\mu}}{\partial x_{\beta}} B_{\alpha} A^{\beta}
  = B_{\alpha} A^{\alpha}.
"></span>
In particular, the derivatives <img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 4.782ex; height: 5.056ex;" src="images/374.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_{\alpha}}"> of a scalar
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/257.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi">, are components
of a co-variant vector, which, with the co-ordinate differentials,
form the scalar <img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 8.842ex; height: 5.056ex;" src="images/375.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_{\alpha}}\, dx_{\alpha}">;
we see from this example how natural
is the definition of the co-variant vectors.
</p>
<p>
There are here, also, tensors of any rank, which may have
co-variant or contra-variant character with respect to each index;
as with vectors, the character is designated by the position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of the index. For example, <img style="vertical-align: -0.904ex; width: 2.849ex; height: 2.524ex;" src="images/376.svg" alt=" " data-tex="{A_{\mu}^{\nu}}"> denotes a tensor of the second
rank, which is co-variant with respect to the index <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu">, and contra-variant
with respect to the index <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu">. The tensor character indicates
that the equation of transformation is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 29.54ex; height: 5.484ex;" src="images/377.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
{{A'}_{\mu}^{\nu}}
  = \frac{\partial x_{\alpha}}{{\partial x'}_{\mu}}
    \frac{{\partial x'}_{\nu}}{\partial x_{\beta}} A_{\alpha}^{\beta}.
\qquad \text{(58)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
Tensors may be formed by the addition and subtraction of
tensors of equal rank and like character, as in the theory of
invariants of orthogonal linear substitutions, for example,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.904ex; width: 23.929ex; height: 2.601ex;" src="images/378.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
A_{\mu}^{\nu} + B_{\mu}^{\nu} = C_{\mu}^{\nu}.

The proof of the tensor character of <img style="vertical-align: -0.904ex; width: 2.873ex; height: 2.499ex;" src="images/379.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C_{\mu}^{\nu}"> depends upon (58).
</p>
<p>
Tensors may be formed by multiplication, keeping the character
of the indices, just as in the theory of invariants of linear
orthogonal transformations, for example,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.904ex; width: 23.576ex; height: 2.601ex;" src="images/380.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
A_{\mu}^{\nu} B_{\sigma\tau} = C_{\mu\sigma\tau}^{\nu}.
\qquad \text{(60)}
"></span>
The proof follows directly from the rule of transformation.
</p>
<p>
Tensors may be formed by contraction with respect to two
indices of different character, for example,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.904ex; width: 20.806ex; height: 2.601ex;" src="images/381.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

The properties of symmetry and skew-symmetry of a tensor
with respect to two indices of like character have the same
significance as in the theory of invariants.

With this, everything essential has been said with regard to

<i>The Fundamental Tensor</i>. It follows from the invariance
of <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 3.225ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/360.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds^{2}">for an arbitrary choice of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.506ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\nu}">, in connexion with
the condition of symmetry consistent with (55), that the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">
are components of a symmetrical co-variant tensor (Fundamental
Tensor). Let us form the determinant, <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.079ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/385.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g">, of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">, and
also the minors, divided by <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.079ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/385.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g">, corresponding to the single <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">.
These minors, divided by <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.079ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/385.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g">, will be denoted by <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.992ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\mu\nu}">, and their
co-variant character is not yet known. Then we have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 36.542ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/387.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
g_{\mu\alpha} g^{\mu\beta} = \delta_{\alpha}^{\beta}
  = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if \(\alpha = \beta,\)} \\
    0 & \text{if \(\alpha \neq \beta.\)}
  \end{cases}
\qquad \text{(62)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
If we form the infinitely small quantities (co-variant vectors)
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 23.206ex; height: 2.382ex;" src="images/388.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

multiply by <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.992ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\mu\nu}"> and sum over the <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu">, we obtain, by the use
of (62),
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 22.969ex; height: 2.747ex;" src="images/389.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
dx_{\beta} = g^{\beta\mu}\, d\xi_{\mu}.
\qquad \text{(64)}
"></span>
Since the ratios of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.32ex; height: 2.278ex;" src="images/390.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d\xi_{\mu}">, are arbitrary, and the <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.564ex; height: 2.22ex;" src="images/391.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\beta}"> as well as
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.623ex; height: 2.255ex;" src="images/392.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\mu}"> are components of vectors, it follows that the <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.992ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\mu\nu}"> are the
components of a contra-variant tensor<a id="FNanchor_15_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_1" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
(contra-variant fundamental tensor).
The tensor character of <img style="vertical-align: -0.332ex; width: 2.216ex; height: 2.57ex;" src="images/393.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta_{\alpha}^{\beta}"> (mixed fundamental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
tensor) accordingly follows, by (62). By means of the fundamental
tensor, instead of tensors with co-variant index character, we
can introduce tensors with contra-variant index character, and
conversely. For example,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -3.736ex; width: 12.845ex; height: 8.603ex;" src="images/394.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

A^{\mu} &= g^{\mu\alpha} A_{\alpha}, \\
A_{\mu} &= g_{\mu\alpha} A^{\alpha}, \\
T_{\mu}^{\sigma} &= g^{\sigma\nu} T_{\mu\nu}.
\end{align*}
"></span>
</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind"><a id="Footnote_15_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_1"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>If we multiply (64)
by <img style="vertical-align: -2.202ex; width: 5.41ex; height: 5.448ex;" src="images/395.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{{\partial x'}_{\alpha}}{\partial x_{\beta}}">,
sum over the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">, and replace the <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.32ex; height: 2.057ex;" src="images/396.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d\xi^{\mu}"> by

      \frac{{\partial x'}_{\alpha}}{\partial x_{\beta}}\, g^{\mu\beta}\, {d\xi'}_{\sigma}.
"></span>
The statement made above follows from this, since, by (64), we must also
have <img style="vertical-align: -0.561ex; width: 15.36ex; height: 2.597ex;" src="images/398.svg" alt=" " data-tex="{dx'}_{\alpha} = g^{\sigma\alpha'}\, {d\xi'}_{\alpha}"> and both equations

<p>
<i>Volume Invariants</i>. The volume element
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.948ex; width: 22.967ex; height: 5.027ex;" src="images/400.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\int dx_{1}\, dx_{2}\, dx_{3}\, dx_{4} = dx
"></span>
is not an invariant. For by Jacobi's theorem,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.312ex; width: 24.893ex; height: 5.754ex;" src="images/401.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
dx' = \left| \frac{{dx'}_{\mu}}{dx_{\nu}}\right| dx.
\qquad \text{(65)}
"></span>
But we can complement <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.471ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/402.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx"> so that it becomes an invariant. If
we form the determinant of the quantities

    \frac{\partial x_{\beta}}{{\partial x'}_{\nu}}\, g_{\alpha\beta},
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
we obtain, by a double application of the theorem of multiplication
of determinants,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.312ex; width: 49.262ex; height: 6.202ex;" src="images/404.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

We therefore get the invariant,

<i>Formation of Tensors by Differentiation</i>. Although the algebraic
operations of tensor formation have proved to be as
simple as in the special case of invariance with respect to linear
orthogonal transformations, nevertheless in the general case,
the invariant differential operations are, unfortunately, considerably
more complicated. The reason for this is as follows. If
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.849ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\mu}"> is a contra-variant vector, the coefficients of its
transformation, <img style="vertical-align: -1.891ex; width: 5.35ex; height: 5.334ex;" src="images/407.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{{\partial x'}_{\mu}}{\partial x_{\nu}}">, are
independent of position only if the transformation
is a linear one. For then the vector components,
<img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 14.8ex; height: 5.058ex;" src="images/408.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\mu} + \dfrac{\partial A^{\mu}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}\, dx_{\alpha}">,
at a neighbouring point transform in the same way as the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.849ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\mu}">,
from which follows the vector character of the vector differentials,
and the tensor character of <img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 5.125ex; height: 5.058ex;" src="images/409.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\partial A^{\mu}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}">.
But if the <img style="vertical-align: -1.891ex; width: 5.35ex; height: 5.334ex;" src="images/407.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{{\partial x'}_{\mu}}{\partial x_{\nu}}">
are variable this is no longer true.
</p>
<p>
That there are, nevertheless, in the general case, invariant
differential operations for tensors, is recognized most satisfactorily
in the following way, introduced by Levi-Civita and Weyl.
Let (<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.849ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\mu}">) be a contra-variant vector whose components are given
with respect to the co-ordinate system of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}">.
Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
be two infinitesimally near points of the continuum. For the infinitesimal
region surrounding the point <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">, there is, according
to our way of considering the matter, a co-ordinate system of
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.909ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{\nu}"> (with imaginary <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/362.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{4}">-co-ordinate) for which the
continuum is Euclidean. Let <img style="vertical-align: -1.207ex; width: 3.929ex; height: 3.06ex;" src="images/410.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{(1)}^{\mu}"> be the co-ordinates of the vector at
the point <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">. Imagine a vector drawn at the point <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}">, using the
local system of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.909ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_{\nu}">, with the same co-ordinates (parallel vector
through <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}">), then this parallel vector is uniquely determined
by the vector at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> and the displacement. We designate this operation,
whose uniqueness will appear in the sequel, the parallel
displacement of the vector <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 2.849ex; height: 2.305ex;" src="images/411.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\mu}"> from <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> to the infinitesimally near
point <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}">. If we form the vector difference of the vector (<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.849ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\mu}">) at
the point <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> and the vector obtained by parallel displacement
from <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}">, we get a vector which may be regarded as the
differential of the vector (<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.849ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\mu}">) for the given displacement <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.506ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\nu}">.
</p>
<p>
This vector displacement can naturally also be considered
with respect to the co-ordinate system of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}">. If <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.733ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/368.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\nu}"> are the
co-ordinates of the vector at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 9.235ex; height: 1.808ex;" src="images/412.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\nu} + \delta A^{\nu}"> the co-ordinates of
the vector displaced to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> along the interval (<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.506ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\nu}">), then
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 3.737ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/413.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta A^{\nu}">
do not vanish in this case. We know of these quantities, which
do not have a vector character, that they must depend linearly
and homogeneously upon the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.506ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\nu}"> and the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.733ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/368.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\nu}">. We therefore put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.911ex; width: 28.449ex; height: 2.608ex;" src="images/414.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\delta A^{\nu} = -\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\nu} A^{\alpha}\, dx_{\beta}.
\qquad \text{(67)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
In addition, we can state that the <img style="vertical-align: -1.024ex; width: 3.531ex; height: 2.563ex;" src="images/415.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\nu}"> must be symmetrical
with respect to the indices <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">.
For we can assume from
a representation by the aid of a Euclidean system of local co-ordinates
that the same parallelogram will be described by the
displacement of an element <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 5.739ex; height: 2.36ex;" src="images/416.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d^{(1)}x_{\nu}"> along a second element
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 5.739ex; height: 2.36ex;" src="images/417.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d^{(2)}x_{\nu}">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
as by a displacement of <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 5.739ex; height: 2.36ex;" src="images/417.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d^{(2)}x_{\nu}"> along <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 5.739ex; height: 2.36ex;" src="images/416.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d^{(1)}x_{\nu}">.
We must therefore have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.819ex; width: 73.179ex; height: 6.769ex;" src="images/418.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

d^{(2)}x_{\nu} + (d^{(1)}x_{\nu}
  - \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\nu}\, d^{(1)}x_{\alpha}\, d^{(2)}x_{\beta}) \\
  \quad
  &= d^{(1)}x_{\nu} + (d^{(2)}x_{\nu}
  - \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\nu}\, d^{(2)}x_{\alpha}\, d^{(1)}x_{\beta}).
\end{aligned}
"></span>
The statement made above follows from this, after interchanging
the indices of summation, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">, on the right-hand side.
</p>
<p>
Since the quantities <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> determine all the metrical properties
of the continuum, they must also determine the <img style="vertical-align: -1.024ex; width: 3.531ex; height: 2.563ex;" src="images/415.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\nu}">. If we
consider the invariant of the vector <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.733ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/368.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\nu}"> that is, the square of its

"></span>
which is an invariant, this cannot change in a parallel displacement.
We therefore have

the <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.572ex; height: 1.927ex;" src="images/432.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dx_{\sigma}">, it follows that

If we put, further,

We get the law of parallel displacement for the co-variant
vector <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 2.87ex; height: 2.23ex;" src="images/439.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B_{\mu}"> by stipulating that the parallel displacement shall be
effected in such a way that the scalar

remains unchanged, and that therefore

vanishes for every value assigned to (<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.849ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\mu}">). We therefore get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.904ex; width: 26.783ex; height: 2.601ex;" src="images/442.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\delta B_{\mu} = \Gamma_{\mu\sigma}^{\alpha} A_{\alpha}\, dx_{\sigma}.
\qquad \text{(75)}

</p>
<p>
From this we arrive at the co-variant derivative of the co-variant
vector by the same process as that which led to (71),

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
By interchanging the indices <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">, and subtracting, we get
the skew-symmetrical tensor,

</p>
<p>
For the co-variant differentiation of tensors of the second
and higher ranks we may use the process by which (75) was
deduced. Let, for example, (<img style="vertical-align: -0.36ex; width: 3.625ex; height: 1.98ex;" src="images/445.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\sigma\tau}">) be a co-variant tensor of the
second rank. Then <img style="vertical-align: -0.36ex; width: 9.406ex; height: 1.98ex;" src="images/446.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\sigma\tau} E^{\sigma} F^{\tau}"> is a scalar,
if <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/292.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.695ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/447.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F"> are vectors.
This expression must not be changed by the <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.005ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/117.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta">-displacement;
expressing this by a formula, we get, using (67), <img style="vertical-align: -0.36ex; width: 4.63ex; height: 1.982ex;" src="images/448.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta A_{\sigma\tau}">, whence
we get the desired co-variant derivative,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 43.434ex; height: 5.386ex;" src="images/449.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
A_{\sigma\tau;\, \rho}
  = \frac{\partial A_{\sigma\tau}}{\partial x_{\rho}}
  - \Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^{\alpha} A_{\alpha\tau}
  - \Gamma_{\tau\rho}^{\alpha} A_{\sigma\alpha}.
\qquad \text{(78)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
In order that the general law of co-variant differentiation of
tensors may be clearly seen, we shall write down two co-variant
derivatives deduced in an analogous way:
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -5.204ex; width: 48.077ex; height: 11.539ex;" src="images/450.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

A_{\sigma;\, \rho}^{\tau}
  &= \frac{\partial A_{\sigma}^{\tau}}{\partial x_{\rho}}
  - \Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^{\alpha} A_{\alpha}^{\tau}
  + \Gamma_{\alpha\rho}^{\tau} A_{\sigma}^{\alpha},\,
\qquad & &\text{(79)} \\
{A^{\sigma\tau}}_{;\, \rho}

  + \Gamma_{\alpha\rho}^{\sigma} A^{\alpha\tau}
  + \Gamma_{\alpha\rho}^{\tau} A^{\sigma\alpha}.
\qquad & &\text{(80)}
\end{align*}
"></span>
The general law of formation now becomes evident. From these
formulae we shall deduce some others which are of interest for
the physical applications of the theory.
</p>
<p>
In case <img style="vertical-align: -0.36ex; width: 3.625ex; height: 1.98ex;" src="images/445.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\sigma\tau}"> is skew-symmetrical, we obtain the tensor

interchange and addition.

If, in (78), we replace <img style="vertical-align: -0.36ex; width: 3.625ex; height: 1.98ex;" src="images/445.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{\sigma\tau}"> by the fundamental tensor,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.008ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/452.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\sigma\tau}">,
then the right-hand side vanishes identically; an analogous statement
holds for (80) with respect to <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.008ex; height: 1.975ex;" src="images/453.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\sigma\tau}">; that is, the co-variant
derivatives of the fundamental tensor vanish. That this must be
so we see directly in the local system of co-ordinates.
</p>
<p>
In case <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 3.625ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/454.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A^{\sigma\tau}"> is skew-symmetrical, we obtain from (80), by

THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY<br>
(<i>continued</i>)</h2>

<p class="nind">
<span class="dropcap">W</span>E are now in possession of the mathematical apparatus which
is necessary to formulate the laws of the general theory of relativity.
No attempt will be made in this presentation at systematic
completeness, but single results and possibilities will
be developed progressively from what is known and from the results
obtained. Such a presentation is most suited to the present
provisional state of our knowledge.
</p>
<p>
A material particle upon which no force acts moves, according
to the principle of inertia, uniformly in a straight line. In
the four-dimensional continuum of the special theory of relativity
(with real time co-ordinate) this is a real straight line. The
natural, that is, the simplest, generalization of the straight line
which is plausible in the system of concepts of Riemann's general
theory of invariants is that of the straightest, or geodetic,
line. We shall accordingly have to assume, in the sense of the
principle of equivalence, that the motion of a material particle,
under the action only of inertia and gravitation, is described by
the equation,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.651ex; width: 34.843ex; height: 5.264ex;" src="images/482.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{d^{2} x_{\mu}}{ds^{2}}
  + \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu} \frac{dx_{\alpha}}{ds}\, \frac{dx_{\beta}}{ds}
  = 0.
\qquad \text{(90)}
"></span>
In fact, this equation reduces to that of a straight line if all the
components, <img style="vertical-align: -1.045ex; width: 3.531ex; height: 2.898ex;" src="images/461.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}">, of the gravitational field vanish.
</p>
<p>
How are these equations connected with Newton's equations
of motion? According to the special theory of relativity,
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> as well as the <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.992ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\mu\nu}">, have
the values, with respect to an inertial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
system (with real time co-ordinate and suitable choice of the
sign of <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 3.225ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/360.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds^{2}">),
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -5.317ex; width: 28.158ex; height: 11.765ex;" src="images/484.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\begin{array}{*{4}{>{\quad}r}}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0  & 1
\end{array}
\right\}.
\qquad \text{(91)}
"></span>
The equations of motion then become
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.651ex; width: 10.383ex; height: 5.264ex;" src="images/485.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{d^{2} x_{\mu}}{ds^{2}} = 0.
"></span>
We shall call this the "first approximation" to the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">-field. In
considering approximations it is often useful, as in the special
theory of relativity, to use an imaginary <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/239.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{4}">-co-ordinate, as then
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">. to the first approximation, assume the values
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -5.317ex; width: 31.049ex; height: 11.765ex;" src="images/486.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\left.
\begin{array}{*{4}{>{\quad}r}}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0  & -1
\end{array}
\right\}.
\qquad \text{(91a)}
"></span>
These values may be collected in the relation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 11.491ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/487.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
g_{\mu\nu} = -\delta_{\mu\nu}.
"></span>
To the second approximation we must then put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 26.353ex; height: 2.382ex;" src="images/488.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
g_{\mu\nu} = -\delta_{\mu\nu} + \gamma_{\mu\nu},
\qquad \text{(92)}
"></span>
where the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.172ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/489.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma_{\mu\nu}"> are to be regarded as small of the first order.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
</p>
<p>
Both terms of our equation of motion are then small of the
first order. If we neglect terms which, relatively to these, are
small of the first order, we have to put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -3.856ex; width: 67.308ex; height: 8.843ex;" src="images/490.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

  - \frac{\partial \gamma_{\beta\mu}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}\right).

We shall now introduce an approximation of a second kind. Let
the velocity of the material particles be very small compared to
that of light. Then <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.238ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/346.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds"> will be the same as the time differential, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.851ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/282.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dl">.
Further, <img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 4.454ex; height: 4.674ex;" src="images/491.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{dx_{1}}{ds}">, <img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 4.454ex; height: 4.674ex;" src="images/492.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{dx_{2}}{ds}">, <img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 4.454ex; height: 4.674ex;" src="images/493.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{dx_{3}}{ds}">
will vanish compared to <img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 4.454ex; height: 4.674ex;" src="images/494.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{dx_{4}}{ds}">.
We shall assume, in addition, that the gravitational field varies
so little with the time that the derivatives of the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.172ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/489.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma_{\mu\nu}"> by <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/239.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{4}"> may
be neglected. Then the equation of motion (for <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu"> = 1,2,3)
reduces to
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 30.687ex; height: 5.849ex;" src="images/495.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{d^{2} x_{\mu}}{dl^{2}}
  = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\mu}} \left(\frac{\gamma_{44}}{2}\right).
\qquad \text{(90a)}
"></span>
This equation is identical with Newton's equation of motion for
a material particle in a gravitational field, if we identify
<img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 6.656ex; height: 4.153ex;" src="images/496.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\left(\dfrac{\gamma_{44}}{2}\right)">
with the potential of the gravitational field; whether or not this
is allowable, naturally depends upon the field equations of gravitation,
that is, it depends upon whether or not this quantity
satisfies, to a first approximation, the same laws of the field
as the gravitational potential in Newton's theory. A glance at
(90) and (90a) shows that the <img style="vertical-align: -1.045ex; width: 3.531ex; height: 2.898ex;" src="images/461.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}"> actually do play the rôle of
the intensity of the gravitational field. These quantities do not
have a tensor character.
</p>
<p>
Equations (90) express the influence of inertia and gravitation
upon the material particle. The unity of inertia and gravitation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
is formally expressed by the fact that the whole left-hand
side of (90) has the character of a tensor (with respect to any
transformation of co-ordinates), but the two terms taken separately
do not have tensor character, so that, in analogy with
Newton's equations, the first term would be regarded as the expression
for inertia, and the second as the expression for the
gravitational force.
</p>
<p>
We must next attempt to find the laws of the gravitational
field. For this purpose, Poisson's equation,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 11.852ex; height: 2.109ex;" src="images/497.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\Delta\phi = 4\pi K\rho
"></span>
of the Newtonian theory must serve as a model. This equation
has its foundation in the idea that the gravitational field
arises from the density <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/118.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\rho"> of ponderable matter. It must also
be so in the general theory of relativity. But our investigations
of the special theory of relativity have shown that in place of
the scalar density of matter we have the tensor of energy per
unit volume. In the latter is included not only the tensor of
the energy of ponderable matter, but also that of the electromagnetic
energy. We have seen, indeed, that in a more complete
analysis the energy tensor can be regarded only as a provisional
means of representing matter. In reality, matter consists of electrically
charged particles, and is to be regarded itself as a part,
in fact, the principal part, of the electromagnetic field. It is
only the circumstance that we have not sufficient knowledge of
the electromagnetic field of concentrated charges that compels
us, provisionally, to leave undetermined in presenting the theory,
the true form of this tensor. From this point of view our
problem now is to introduce a tensor, <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.322ex; height: 2.217ex;" src="images/310.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{\mu\nu}">. of the second rank,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
whose structure we do not know provisionally, and which includes
in itself the energy density of the electromagnetic field
and of ponderable matter; we shall denote this in the following
as the "energy tensor of matter."
</p>
<p>
According to our previous results, the principles of momentum
and energy are expressed by the statement that the divergence
of this tensor vanishes (47c). In the general theory of relativity,
we shall have to assume as valid the corresponding general
co-variant equation. If (<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.322ex; height: 2.217ex;" src="images/310.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{\mu\nu}">) denotes the co-variant energy tensor
of matter, <img style="vertical-align: -0.576ex; width: 2.615ex; height: 2.162ex;" src="images/498.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mathfrak T_{\sigma}^{\nu}"> the corresponding mixed tensor density, then,
in accordance with (83), we must require that
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 26.609ex; height: 5.144ex;" src="images/499.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
0 = \frac{\partial \mathfrak T_{\sigma}^{\alpha}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}
  - \Gamma_{\sigma\beta}^{\alpha} \mathfrak T_{\alpha}^{\beta}
\qquad \text{(95)}
"></span>
be satisfied. It must be remembered that besides the energy density
of the matter there must also be given an energy density of
the gravitational field, so that there can be no talk of principles
of conservation of energy and momentum for matter alone. This
is expressed mathematically by the presence of the second term
in (95), which makes it impossible to conclude the existence of
an integral equation of the form of (49). The gravitational field
transfers energy and momentum to the "matter," in that it exerts
forces upon it and gives it energy; this is expressed by the
second term in (95).
</p>
<p>
If there is an analogue of Poisson's equation in the general
theory of relativity, then this equation must be a tensor equation
for the tensor <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> of the gravitational potential; the energy
tensor of matter must appear on the right-hand side of this
equation. On the left-hand side of the equation there must be
a differential tensor in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">. We have to find this differential
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
tensor. It is completely determined by the following three
conditions:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. It may contain no differential coefficients of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> higher
than the second.
</p>
<p>
2. It must be linear and homogeneous in these second differential
coefficients.

3. Its divergence must vanish identically.
</p>
<p>
The first two of these conditions are naturally taken from
Poisson's equation. Since it may be proved mathematically
that all such differential tensors can be formed algebraically
(i.e. without differentiation) from Riemann's tensor, our tensor
must be of the form
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 13.106ex; height: 2.23ex;" src="images/500.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
R_{\mu\nu} + ag_{\mu\nu} R,
"></span>
in which <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.718ex; height: 2.23ex;" src="images/478.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R_{\mu\nu}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/211.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R"> are defined by (88) and (89) respectively.
Further, it may be proved that the third condition requires a
to have the value <img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 3.887ex; height: 4.588ex;" src="images/501.svg" alt=" " data-tex="-\dfrac{1}{2}">. For the law of the gravitational field we
therefore get the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 32.031ex; height: 2.737ex;" src="images/502.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu} R = - \kappa T_{\mu\nu}.
\qquad \text{(96)}
"></span>
Equation (95) is a consequence of this equation. <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/503.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\kappa"> denotes a
constant, which is connected with the Newtonian gravitation
constant.
</p>
<p>
In the following I shall indicate the features of the theory
which are interesting from the point of view of physics, using as
little as possible of the rather involved mathematical method.
It must first be shown that the divergence of the left-hand side
actually vanishes. The energy principle for matter may be expressed, by (83),
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 27.615ex; height: 5.144ex;" src="images/504.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
0 = \frac{\partial \mathfrak T_{\sigma}^{\alpha}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}
  - \Gamma_{\sigma\beta}^{\alpha} \mathfrak T_{\alpha}^{\beta},
\qquad \text{(97)}
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
in which
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.669ex; width: 17.886ex; height: 2.851ex;" src="images/505.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\mathfrak T_{\sigma}^{\alpha} = T_{\sigma\tau} g^{\tau\alpha} \sqrt{-g}.
"></span>
The analogous operation, applied to the left-hand side of (96),
will lead to an identity.
</p>
<p>
In the region surrounding each world-point there are systems
of co-ordinates for which, choosing the <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/239.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{4}">-co-ordinate imaginary,
at the given point,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 34.922ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/506.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
g_{\mu\nu} = g^{\mu\nu}
  = -\delta_{\mu\nu}
  = \begin{cases}
    -1 & \text{if \(\mu = \nu\)}, \\
     \,\,\,\,0 & \text{if \(\mu \neq \nu\)},
  \end{cases}
"></span>
and for which the first derivatives of the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> and the <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.992ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\mu\nu}"> vanish.
We shall verify the vanishing of the divergence of the left-hand
side at this point. At this point the components
<img style="vertical-align: -1.042ex; width: 3.421ex; height: 2.58ex;" src="images/507.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Gamma_{\sigma\beta}^{\alpha}"> vanish, so
that we have to prove the vanishing only of
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 30.825ex; height: 5.056ex;" src="images/508.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\sigma}} \left[
  \sqrt{-g}\, g^{\nu\sigma} (R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu} R)
\right].
"></span>
Introducing (88) and (70) into this expression, we see that the
only terms that remain are those in which third derivatives of
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.992ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\mu\nu}"> enter. Since the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> are to be replaced by
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 4.765ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/509.svg" alt=" " data-tex="-\delta_{\mu\nu}">, we obtain,
finally, only a few terms which may easily be seen to cancel
each other. Since the quantity that we have formed has a tensor
character, its vanishing is proved for every other system of co-ordinates
also, and naturally for every other four-dimensional
point. The energy principle of matter (97) is thus a mathematical
consequence of the field equations (96).
</p>
<p>
In order to learn whether the equations (96) are consistent
with experience, we must, above all else, find out whether they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
lead to the Newtonian theory as a first approximation. For this
purpose we must introduce various approximations into these
equations. We already know that Euclidean geometry and the
law of the constancy of the velocity of light are valid, to a certain
approximation, in regions of a great extent, as in the planetary
system. If, as in the special theory of relativity, we take the
fourth co-ordinate imaginary, this means that we must put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 26.353ex; height: 2.382ex;" src="images/510.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
g_{\mu\nu} = -\delta_{\mu\nu} + \gamma_{\mu\nu},
\qquad \text{(98)}
"></span>
in which the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.172ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/489.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma_{\mu\nu}"> are so small compared to 1 that we can neglect
the higher powers of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.172ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/489.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma_{\mu\nu}"> and their derivatives. If we do this,
we learn nothing about the structure of the gravitational held, or
of metrical space of cosmical dimensions, but we do learn about
the influence of neighbouring masses upon physical phenomena.
</p>
<p>
Before carrying through this approximation we shall transform
(96). We multiply (96) by <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.992ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\mu\nu}">, summed over the <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu">
observing the relation which follows from the definition of
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.992ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g^{\mu\nu}">,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 10.936ex; height: 2.326ex;" src="images/511.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
g_{\mu\nu} g^{\mu\nu} = 4,
"></span>
we obtain the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 18.981ex; height: 2.326ex;" src="images/512.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
R = \kappa g^{\mu\nu} T_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T.
"></span>
If we put this value of <img style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/211.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R"> in (96) we obtain

  = -\kappa T_{\mu\nu}^{*}.
\qquad \text{(96a)}
"></span>
When the approximation which has been mentioned is carried
out, we obtain for the left-hand side,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.827ex; width: 48.357ex; height: 6.785ex;" src="images/514.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\right)

  = \gamma_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_{\sigma\sigma}\delta_{\mu\nu}.
\qquad \text{(99)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
We must now note that equation (96) is valid for any system
of co-ordinates. We have already specialized the system of
co-ordinates in that we have chosen it so that within the region
considered the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> differ infinitely little from the constant values
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 4.765ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/509.svg" alt=" " data-tex="-\delta_{\mu\nu}">. But this condition remains satisfied in any infinitesimal
change of co-ordinates, so that there are still four conditions
to which the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.172ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/489.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma_{\mu\nu}"> may be subjected, provided these conditions
do not conflict with the conditions for the order of magnitude of
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.172ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/489.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma_{\mu\nu}">. We shall now assume that the system of co-ordinates
is so chosen that the four relations&mdash;
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.237ex; width: 38.565ex; height: 5.909ex;" src="images/517.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
0 = \frac{{\partial\gamma'}_{\mu\nu}}{\partial x_{\nu}}
  = \frac{\partial\gamma_{\mu\nu}}{\partial x_{\nu}}
  - \tfrac{1}{2} \frac{\partial\gamma_{\sigma\sigma}}{\partial x_{\mu}}
\qquad \text{(100)}
"></span>
are satisfied. Then (96a) takes the form
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.332ex; width: 26.138ex; height: 5.944ex;" src="images/518.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{\partial^{2} \gamma_{\mu\nu}}{{\partial x_{\alpha}}^{2}} = 2\kappa T_{\mu\nu}^{*}.
\qquad \text{(96b)}
"></span>
These equations may be solved by the method, familiar in
electrodynamics, of retarded potentials; we get, in an easily
understood notation,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.948ex; width: 48.917ex; height: 5.59ex;" src="images/519.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\gamma_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{\kappa}{2\pi} \int
  \frac{T_{\mu\nu}^{*}(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}, t - r)}{r}\, dV_{0}.
\qquad \text{(101)}
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
</p>
<p>
In order to see in what sense this theory contains the Newtonian
theory, we must consider in greater detail the energy
tensor of matter. Considered phenomenologically, this energy
tensor is composed of that of the electromagnetic field and of
matter in the narrower sense. If we consider the different parts
of this energy tensor with respect to their order of magnitude,
it follows from the results of the special theory of relativity that
the contribution of the electromagnetic field practically vanishes
in comparison to that of ponderable matter. In our system of
units, the energy of one gram of matter is equal to 1, compared
to which the energy of the electric fields may be ignored, and
also the energy of deformation of matter, and even the chemical
energy. We get an approximation that is fully sufficient for our
purpose if we put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -3.551ex; width: 30.02ex; height: 8.234ex;" src="images/520.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\left.
\begin{aligned}
T^{\mu\nu} &= \sigma \frac{dx_{\mu}}{ds}\, \frac{dx_{\nu}}{ds}, \\
ds^{2} &= g_{\mu\nu}\, dx_{\mu}\, dx_{\nu}.
\end{aligned}
\right\}
\qquad \text{(102)}
"></span>
In this, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma"> is the density at rest, that is, the density of the ponderable
matter, in the ordinary sense, measured with the aid
of a unit measuring rod, and referred to a Galilean system of
co-ordinates moving with the matter.
</p>
<p>
We observe, further, that in the co-ordinates we have chosen,
we shall make only a relatively small error if we replace the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">
by <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 4.765ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/509.svg" alt=" " data-tex="-\delta_{\mu\nu}">, so that we put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.018ex; width: 28.45ex; height: 3.167ex;" src="images/521.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ds^{2} = -\sum {dx_{\mu}}^{2}.
\qquad \text{(102a)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
The previous developments are valid however rapidly the
masses which generate the field may move relatively to our chosen
system of quasi-Galilean co-ordinates. But in astronomy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
we have to do with masses whose velocities, relatively to the
co-ordinate system employed, are always small compared to the
velocity of light, that is, small compared to 1, with our choice
of the unit of time. We therefore get an approximation which is
sufficient for nearly all practical purposes if in (101) we replace
the retarded potential by the ordinary (non-retarded) potential,
and if, for the masses which generate the field, we put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 60.851ex; height: 5.187ex;" src="images/522.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\frac{dx_{4}}{ds} = \frac{\sqrt{-1}\, dl}{dl} = \sqrt{-1}.
\qquad \text{(103)}
"></span>
Then we get for <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 3.72ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/523.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T^{\mu\nu}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.322ex; height: 2.217ex;" src="images/310.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{\mu\nu}"> the values

For <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.593ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/525.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T"> we get the value <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma">, and, finally,

We thus get, from (101),

in connexion with equation (90a), contains Newton's theory of
gravitation. If we replace <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.674ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/199.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l"> by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.796ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/206.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ct"> we get

We see that the Newtonian gravitation constant <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, is connected
with the constant <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/503.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\kappa"> that enters into our field equations by the
relation

\qquad \text{(105)}
"></span>
From the known numerical value of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">, it therefore follows that
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.914ex; width: 53.752ex; height: 5.398ex;" src="images/531.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\kappa = \frac{8\pi K}{c^{2}}
  = \frac{8\pi·6.67·10^{-8}}{9·10^{20}}
  = 1.86·10^{-27}.
\qquad \text{(105a)}
"></span>
From (101) we see that even in the first approximation the structure
of the gravitational field differs fundamentally from that
which is consistent with the Newtonian theory; this difference
lies in the fact that the gravitational potential has the character
of a tensor and not a scalar. This was not recognized in the past
because only the component <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.867ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/532.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{44}">, to a first approximation, enters
the equations of motion of material particles.

<p>
In order now to be able to judge the behaviour of measuring
rods and clocks from our results, we must observe the following.
According to the principle of equivalence, the metrical relations
of the Euclidean geometry are valid relatively to a Cartesian
system of reference of infinitely small dimensions, and in a suitable
state of motion (freely falling, and without rotation). We
can make the same statement for local systems of co-ordinates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
which, relatively to these, have small accelerations, and therefore
for such systems of co-ordinates as are at rest relatively to
the one we have selected. For such a local system, we have, for
two neighbouring point events,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 51.054ex; height: 2.457ex;" src="images/533.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ds^{2} = - {dX_{1}}^{2} - {dX_{2}}^{2} - {dX_{3}}^{2} + dT^{2}
  = - dS^{2} + dT^{2},

where <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.636ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/534.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dS"> is measured directly by a measuring rod and <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.769ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/535.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dT"> by
a clock at rest relatively to the system; these are the naturally
measured lengths and times. Since <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 3.225ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/360.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds^{2}">, on the other hand, is
known in terms of the co-ordinates <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.33ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\nu}"> employed in finite regions,

we have the possibility of getting the relation between naturally
measured lengths and times, on the one hand, and the corresponding
differences of co-ordinates, on the other hand. As the
division into space and time is in agreement with respect to the
two systems of co-ordinates, so when we equate the two expressions
for <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 3.225ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/360.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds^{2}"> we get two relations. If, by (101a), we put

   +  \mspace{26mu}\left(1 - \frac{\kappa}{4\pi} \int \frac{\sigma\, dV_{0}}{r}\right) dl^{2},

we obtain, to a sufficiently close approximation,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -7.645ex; width: 63.489ex; height: 16.421ex;" src="images/538.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
</p>
<p>
The unit measuring rod has therefore the length,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.948ex; width: 16.351ex; height: 5.048ex;" src="images/539.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
1 - \frac{\kappa}{8\pi} \int \frac{\sigma\, dV_{0}}{r}
"></span>
in respect to the system of co-ordinates we have selected. The
particular system of co-ordinates we have selected insures that
this length shall depend only upon the place, and not upon the
direction. If we had chosen a different system of co-ordinates
this would not be so. But however we may choose a system of
co-ordinates, the laws of configuration of rigid rods do not agree
with those of Euclidean geometry; in other words, we cannot
choose any system of co-ordinates so that the co-ordinate differences,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/8.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{1}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{2}">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 4.166ex; height: 1.994ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{3}">, corresponding
to the ends of a unit measuring rod, oriented in any way,
shall always satisfy the relation
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 22.179ex; height: 2.572ex;" src="images/540.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta x_{1}^{2} + \Delta x_{2}^{2} + \Delta x_{3}^{2} = 1">.
In this sense space is not Euclidean,
but "curved." It follows from the second of the relations above
that the interval between two beats of the unit clock (<img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.769ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/535.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dT"> = 1)
corresponds to the "time"
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.948ex; width: 16.351ex; height: 5.048ex;" src="images/541.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
1 + \frac{\kappa}{8\pi} \int \frac{\sigma\, dV_{0}}{r}
"></span>
in the unit used in our system of co-ordinates. The rate of a
clock is accordingly slower the greater is the mass of the ponderable
matter in its neighbourhood. We therefore conclude that
spectral lines which are produced on the sun's surface will be
displaced towards the red, compared to the corresponding lines
produced on the earth, by about 2 • 10<sup>-6</sup> of their wave-lengths.
At first, this important consequence of the theory appeared to
conflict with experiment; but results obtained during the past
year seem to make the existence of this effect more probable, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
it can hardly be doubted that this consequence of the theory will
be confirmed within the next year.
</p>
<p>
Another important consequence of the theory, which can be
tested experimentally, has to do with the path of rays of light.
In the general theory of relativity also the velocity of light is
everywhere the same, relatively to a local inertial system. This
velocity is unity in our natural measure of time. The law of
the propagation of light in general co-ordinates is therefore,
according to the general theory of relativity, characterized, by the
equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 7.374ex; height: 2.185ex;" src="images/542.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ds^{2} = 0
"></span>
To within the approximation which we are using, and in the
system of co-ordinates which we have selected, the velocity of
light is characterized, according to (106), by the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 66.477ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/543.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\biggl(1 + \frac{\kappa}{4\pi} \int \frac{\sigma\, dV_{0}}{r}\biggr)
  ({dx_{1}}^{2} + {dx_{2}}^{2} + {dx_{3}}^{2})
  = \biggl(1 - \frac{\kappa}{4\pi} \int \frac{\sigma\, dV_{0}}{r}\biggr) dl^{2}.
"></span>
The velocity of light <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.541ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/544.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L">, is therefore expressed in our co-ordinates
by
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.948ex; width: 52.226ex; height: 5.945ex;" src="images/545.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{\sqrt{{dx_{1}}^{2} + {dx_{2}}^{2} + {dx_{3}}^{2}}}{dl}
  = 1 - \frac{\kappa}{4\pi} \int \frac{\sigma\, dV_{0}}{r}.
\qquad \text{(107)}
"></span>
We can therefore draw the conclusion from this, that a ray of
light passing near a large mass is deflected. If we imagine the
sun, of mass <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.378ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/168.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M"> concentrated at the origin of our system of co-ordinates,
then a ray of fight, travelling parallel to the <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{3}">-axis.
in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 7.329ex; height: 1.694ex;" src="images/546.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{1}-x_{3}"> plane, at a distance <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.885ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta"> from the origin, will be
deflected, in all, by an amount
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.159ex; width: 21.475ex; height: 5.553ex;" src="images/547.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\alpha = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{L}\, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}\, dx_{3}
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
towards the sun. On performing the integration we get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 20.451ex; height: 4.652ex;" src="images/548.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\alpha = \frac{\kappa M}{2\pi\Delta}.
\qquad \text{(108)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
The existence of this deflection, which amounts to 1.7<code>''</code> for
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.885ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\Delta"> equal to the radius of the sun, was confirmed, with remarkable
accuracy, by the English Solar Eclipse Expedition in 1919, and
most careful preparations have been made to get more exact
observational data at the solar eclipse in 1922. It should be
noted that this result, also, of the theory is not influenced by
our arbitrary choice of a system of co-ordinates.
</p>
<p>
This is the place to speak of the third consequence of the
theory which can be tested by observation, namely, that which
concerns the motion of the perihelion of the planet Mercury. The
secular changes in the planetary orbits are known with such accuracy
that the approximation we have been using is no longer
sufficient for a comparison of theory and observation. It is necessary
to go back to the general field equations (96). To solve
this problem I made use of the method of successive approximations.
Since then, however, the problem of the central symmetrical
statical gravitational field has been completely solved by
Schwarzschild and others; the derivation given by H. Weyl in his
book, "Raum-Zeit-Materie," is particularly elegant. The calculation
can be simplified somewhat if we do not go back directly
to the equation (96), but base it upon a principle of variation
that is equivalent to this equation. I shall indicate the procedure
only in so far as is necessary for understanding the method.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
</p>
<p>
In the case of a statical field, <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 3.225ex; height: 1.909ex;" src="images/360.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds^{2}"> must have the form

\end{aligned}
\right\}
\qquad \text{(109)}
"></span>
where the summation on the right-hand side of the last equation
is to be extended over the space variables only. The central
symmetry of the field requires the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.172ex; height: 1.683ex;" src="images/489.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma_{\mu\nu}">, to be of the form,

of these three functions can be chosen arbitrarily, because our
system of co-ordinates is, <i>a priori</i>, completely arbitrary; for by
a substitution

\begin{align*}
{x'}_{4} &= x_{4}, \\
{x'}_{\alpha} &= F(r) x_{\alpha},

we can always insure that one of these three functions shall be
an assigned function of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">'. In place of (110) we can therefore
put, without limiting the generality,

In (109c), (111) and (112) we have three equations between

planet may be calculated in the same way as in classical mechanics.
The most important result we get from this is a secular
rotation of the elliptic orbit of the planet in the same sense as
the revolution of the planet, amounting in radians per revolution
to

There is no difficulty in expressing Maxwell's theory of the
electromagnetic field in terms of the general theory of relativity;
this is done by application of the tensor formation (81), (82)
and (77). Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 2.501ex; height: 2.255ex;" src="images/568.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi_{\mu}"> be a tensor of the first rank, to be denoted
as an electromagnetic 4-potential; then an electromagnetic field
tensor may be defined by the relations,

unsatisfactory by many theoreticians. Nor can we in this way
conceive of the equilibrium of the electricity which constitutes
the elementary electrically charged particles. A theory in which
the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field enter as an
essential entity would be much preferable. H. Weyl, and recently
Th. Kaluza, have discovered some ingenious theorems along this
direction; but concerning them, I am convinced that they do not
bring us nearer to the true solution of the fundamental problem.
I shall not go into this further, but shall give a brief discussion
of the so-called cosmological problem, for without this, the considerations
regarding the general theory of relativity would, in
a certain sense, remain unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p>
Our previous considerations, based upon the field equations (96),
had for a foundation the conception that space on
the whole is Galilean-Euclidean, and that this character is disturbed
only by masses embedded in it. This conception was
certainly justified as long as we were dealing with spaces of the
order of magnitude of those that astronomy has to do with.
But whether portions of the universe, however large they may
be, are quasi-Euclidean, is a wholly different question. We can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
make this clear by using an example from the theory of surfaces
which we have employed many times. If a portion of a surface
is observed by the eye to be practically plane, it does not at all
follow that the whole surface has the form of a plane; the surface
might just as well be a sphere, for example, of sufficiently large
radius. The question as to whether the universe as a whole is
non-Euclidean was much discussed from the geometrical point of
view before the development of the theory of relativity. But with
the theory of relativity, this problem has entered upon a new
stage, for according to this theory the geometrical properties of
bodies are not independent, but depend upon the distribution
of masses.
</p>
<p>
If the universe were quasi-Euclidean, then Mach was wholly
wrong in his thought that inertia, as well as gravitation, depends
upon a kind of mutual action between bodies. For in this case,
with a suitably selected system of co-ordinates, the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> would
be constant at infinity, as they are in the special theory of relativity,
while within finite regions the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}"> would differ from these
constant values by small amounts only, with a suitable choice
of co-ordinates, as a result of the influence of the masses in finite
regions. The physical properties of space would not then be
wholly independent, that is, uninfluenced by matter, but in the
main they would be, and only in small measure, conditioned by
matter. Such a dualistic conception is even in itself not satisfactory;
there are, however, some important physical arguments
against it, which we shall consider.
</p>
<p>
The hypothesis that the universe is infinite and Euclidean
at infinity, is, from the relativistic point of view, a complicated
hypothesis. In the language of the general theory of relativity
it demands that the Riemann tensor of the fourth rank
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 5.172ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/574.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R_{iklm}">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
shall vanish at infinity, which furnishes twenty independent conditions,
while only ten curvature components <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.718ex; height: 2.23ex;" src="images/478.svg" alt=" " data-tex="R_{\mu\nu}">, enter into
the laws of the gravitational field. It is certainly unsatisfactory
to postulate such a far-reaching limitation without any physical
basis for it.
</p>
<p>
But in the second place, the theory of relativity makes it
appear probable that Mach was on the right road in his thought
that inertia depends upon a mutual action of matter. For we
shall show in the following that, according to our equations, inert
masses do act upon each other in the sense of the relativity of
inertia, even if only very feebly. What is to be expected along
the line of Mach's thought?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
1.  The inertia of a body must increase when ponderable
masses are piled up in its neighbourhood.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
2.  A body must experience an accelerating force when
neighbouring masses are accelerated, and, in fact, the
force must be in the same direction as the acceleration.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
3.  A rotating hollow body must generate inside of itself
a "Coriolis field," which deflects moving bodies in the
sense of the rotation, and a radial centrifugal field as
well.
</p>
<p>
We shall now show that these three effects, which are to be
expected in accordance with Mach's ideas, are actually present
according to our theory, although their magnitude is so small
that confirmation of them by laboratory experiments is not to be
thought of. For this purpose we shall go back to the equations of
motion of a material particle (90), and carry the approximations
somewhat further than was done in equation (90a).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
</p>
<p>
First, we consider <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 2.96ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/575.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma_{44}"> as small of the first order. The square
of the velocity of masses moving under the influence of the gravitational
force is of the same order, according to the energy
equation. It is therefore logical to regard the velocities of the
material particles we are considering, as well as the velocities
of the masses which generate the field, as small, of the order
<img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 2.127ex; height: 4.588ex;" src="images/576.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{2}">.
We shall now carry out the approximation in the equations that
arise from the field equations (101) and the equations of motion (90)
so far as to consider terms, in the second member
of (90), that are linear in those velocities. Further, we shall not
put <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.238ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/346.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ds"> and  <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.851ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/282.svg" alt=" " data-tex="dl"> equal to each other, but, corresponding to the
higher approximation, we shall put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 28.33ex; height: 4.153ex;" src="images/577.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ds = \sqrt{g_{44}}\, dl
  = \left(1 - \frac{\gamma_{44}}{2}\right) dl.
"></span>
From (90) we obtain, at first,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 59.568ex; height: 5.444ex;" src="images/578.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

    \left(1 + \frac{\gamma_{44}}{2}\right).

<p>
From (101) we get, to the approximation sought for,

On the right-hand side of (116) we can replace

It is easy to see, in  addition, that to this

<p>
The equations of motion, (118), show now, in fact, that
</p>
<p class="hanging">
1.  The inert mass is proportional to 1 + <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1.742ex;" src="images/584.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\overline{\sigma}"> and therefore
increases when ponderable masses approach the test
body.
</p>
<p class="hanging">
2.  There is an inductive action of accelerated masses,
of the same sign, upon the test body. This is the
term <img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 3.9ex; height: 4.749ex;" src="images/585.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\partial \mathfrak A}{\partial l}">.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
</p>
<p class="hanging">
3. A material particle, moving perpendicularly to the axis
of rotation inside a rotating hollow body, is deflected in
the sense of the rotation (Coriolis field). The centrifugal
action, mentioned above, inside a rotating hollow
body, also follows from the theory, as has been shown
by Thirring.<a id="FNanchor_18_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_1" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind"><a id="Footnote_18_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_1"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>That the centrifugal action must be inseparably connected with the
existence of the Coriolis field may be recognized, even without calculation,
in the special case of a co-ordinate system rotating uniformly relatively to
an inertial system; our general co-variant equations naturally must apply
to such a case.</p></div>

<p>
Although all of these effects are inaccessible to experiment,
because <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/503.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\kappa"> is so small, nevertheless they certainly exist according
to the general theory of relativity. We must see in them a
strong support for Mach's ideas as to the relativity of all inertial
actions. If we think these ideas consistently through to the end
we must expect the <i>whole</i> inertia, that is, the <i>whole</i>
<img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">-field, to
be determined by the matter of the universe, and not mainly by
the boundary conditions at infinity.
</p>
<p>
For a satisfactory conception of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">-field of cosmical dimensions,
the fact seems to be of significance that the relative
velocity of the stars is small compared to the velocity of light.
It follows from this that, with a suitable choice of co-ordinates,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.867ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/532.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{44}"> is nearly constant in the universe, at least, in that part of
the universe in which there is matter. The assumption appears
natural, moreover, that there are stars in all parts of the universe,
so that we may well assume that the inconstancy of <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.867ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/532.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{44}"> depends
only upon the circumstance that matter is not distributed
continuously, but is concentrated in single celestial bodies and
systems of bodies. If we are willing to ignore these more local
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
non-uniformities of the density of matter and of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">-field, in
order to learn something of the geometrical properties of the universe
as a whole, it appears natural to substitute for the actual
distribution of masses a continuous distribution, and furthermore
to assign to this distribution a uniform density <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma">. In this
imagined universe all points with space directions will be geometrically
equivalent; with respect to its space extension it will
have a constant curvature, and will be cylindrical with respect
to its <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/239.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{4}">-co-ordinate. The possibility seems to be particularly
satisfying that the universe is spatially bounded and thus, in
accordance with our assumption of the constancy of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma">, is of
constant curvature, being either spherical or elliptical; for then
the boundary conditions at infinity which are so inconvenient
from the standpoint of the general theory of relativity, may be
replaced by the much more natural conditions for a closed surface.

<p>
According to what has been said, we are to put

a three-dimensional continuum of constant positive curvature. We must
now investigate whether such an assumption can satisfy the field
equations of gravitation.
</p>
<p>
In order to be able to investigate this, we must first find
what differential conditions the three-dimensional manifold of
constant curvature satisfies. A spherical manifold of three dimensions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
embedded in a Euclidean continuum of four dimensions,<a id="FNanchor_19_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_1" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
is given by the equations

of the origin. Since the first derivatives of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 3.08ex; height: 1.685ex;" src="images/367.svg" alt=" " data-tex="g_{\mu\nu}">,

We have

Since the relation

and since all points of the manifold are geometrically equivalent,
this relation holds for every system of co-ordinates, and
everywhere in the manifold. In order to avoid confusion with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the four-dimensional continuum, we shall, in the following, designate
quantities that refer to the three-dimensional continuum
by Greek letters, and put

<p>
We now proceed to apply the field equations (96) to our special
case. From (119) we get for the four-dimensional manifold,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 44.083ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/593.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\right\}
\qquad \text{(121)}
"></span>
</p>
<p>
For the right-hand side of (96) we have to consider the energy
tensor for matter distributed like a cloud of dust. According to
what has gone before we must therefore put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 17.527ex; height: 4.87ex;" src="images/594.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
T^{\mu\nu} = \sigma \frac{dx_{\mu}}{ds}\, \frac{dx_{\nu}}{ds}
"></span>
specialized for the case of rest. But in addition, we shall add
a pressure term that may be physically established as follows.
Matter consists of electrically charged particles. On the basis
of Maxwell's theory these cannot be conceived of as electromagnetic
fields free from singularities. In order to be consistent
with the facts, it is necessary to introduce energy terms, not
contained in Maxwell's theory, so that the single electric particles
may hold together in spite of the mutual repulsions between
their elements, charged with electricity of one sign. For the sake
of consistency with this fact, Poincaré has assumed a pressure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
to exist inside these particles which balances the electrostatic
repulsion. It cannot, however, be asserted that this pressure
vanishes outside the particles. We shall be consistent with this
circumstance if, in our phenomenological presentation, we add
a pressure term. This must not, however, be confused with a
hydrodynamical pressure, as it serves only for the energetic presentation
of the dynamical relations inside matter. In this sense
we put
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 39.787ex; height: 4.835ex;" src="images/595.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
T_{\mu\nu}
  = g_{\mu\sigma} g_{\nu\beta} \frac{dx_{\alpha}}{ds}\, \frac{dx_{\beta}}{ds}
  - g_{\mu\nu} p.
\qquad \text{(122)}
"></span>
</p>

In our special case we have, therefore, to put

\begin{align*}
T_{\mu\nu}
  &= \gamma_{\mu\nu} p \quad \text{(for}\,\,\mu\,\, \text{and}\,\,\,\nu \,\,\text{from 1 to 3)}, \\

Observing that the field equation (96) may be written in the
form
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 24.742ex; height: 2.737ex;" src="images/597.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
R_{\mu\nu} = -\kappa(T_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} T),
"></span>
we get from (96) the equations,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -4.194ex; width: 25.503ex; height: 9.519ex;" src="images/598.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\begin{align*}
+\frac{2}{a^{2}} \gamma_{\mu\nu}
  &=  \kappa \left(\frac{\sigma}{2} - p\right) \gamma_{\mu\nu}, \\
0 &= -\kappa \left(\frac{\sigma}{2} + p\right).
\end{align*}

From this follows

p &= -\frac{\sigma}{2}, \\
a &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\kappa\sigma}}.

If the universe is quasi-Euclidean, and its radius of curvature
therefore infinite, then σ would vanish. But it is improbable that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
the mean density of matter in the universe is actually zero; this
is our third argument against the assumption that the universe
is quasi-Euclidean. Nor does it seem possible that our hypothetical
pressure can vanish; the physical nature of this pressure can
be appreciated only after we have a better theoretical knowledge
of the electromagnetic field. According to the second of equations
(123) the radius, <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a">, of the universe is determined in terms
of the total mass, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.378ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/168.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M">, of matter, by the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 19.575ex; height: 4.728ex;" src="images/600.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
a = \frac{M\kappa}{4\pi^{2}}.
\qquad \text{(124)}
"></span>
The complete dependence of the geometrical upon the physical
properties becomes clearly apparent by means of this equation.
</p>
<p>
Thus we may present the following arguments against the
conception of a space-infinite, and for the conception of a space-bounded,
universe:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. From the standpoint of the theory of relativity, the condition
for a closed surface is very much simpler than the corresponding
boundary condition at infinity of the quasi-Euclidean
structure of the universe.
</p>
<p>
2. The idea that Mach expressed, that inertia depends upon
the mutual action of bodies, is contained, to a first approximation,
in the equations of the theory of relativity; it follows
from these equations that inertia depends, at least in part, upon
mutual actions between masses. As it is an unsatisfactory assumption
to make that inertia depends in part upon mutual
actions, and in part upon an independent property of space,
Mach's idea gains in probability. But this idea of Mach's corresponds
only to a finite universe, bounded in space, and not to a
quasi-Euclidean, infinite universe. From the standpoint of epistemology
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
it is more satisfying to have the mechanical properties
of space completely determined by matter, and this is the case
only in a space-bounded universe.
</p>
<p>
3. An infinite universe is possible only if the mean density of
matter in the universe vanishes. Although such an assumption
is logically possible, it is less probable than the assumption that
there is a finite mean density of matter in the universe.
